It is too hard to tell at the moment, but it didn\u2019t feel good when I went down with it so we will see how the scans go tomorrow,\u201d Ward told Fox Footy after the final siren.\n\u201cI think I was in a shock (on the bench) to be honest. I\u2019ve never hurt my knee like that before and I think I realised that I was out for the year really. It was a great win by the boys and I\u2019m just happy to be here right now.\u201d\nBut from that moment the Giants midfield went to another level, clawing their way back into the contest bit by bit.\nCallan Ward is helped off the ground after hurting his knee on Saturday. Source: Getty Images\nDaniel Lloyd put the Giants in front just before three-quarter time. Tom Hawkins restored order shortly afterwards. Then Jeremy Finlayson levelled the scores for the Giants midway through the final quarter. And from there, the Cats didn\u2019t score again.\nLeon Cameron\u2019s side may have had better wins before, but the four-point win might be the Giants most memorable.\nGeelong hadn\u2019t lost a game this year, hadn\u2019t lost a game at home in nine starts, and had never lost to Greater Western Sydney at the Cattery before the Giants pulled off a stunning win against the odds on Saturday.\nIf you thought the premiership window had closed after the departures of Dylan Shiel, Tom Scully and Rory Lobb, think again.\nGeelong coach Chris Scott yells from the boundary line in the third quarter. Source: News Corp Australia\nGWS vice-captain Stephen Coniglio showed why he is the most sought after free agent in the game right now, producing another brilliant performance that will undoubtedly see his Brownlow Medal odds wound right in this week.\nOn a day where the \u2018Holy Trinity\u2019 all had less than 19 disposals \u2014 and Tim Kelly only touched the ball nine times \u2014 Coniglio amassed 34 disposals, 16 contested possessions and 10 clearances \u2014 seven from the centre square.\n\u201cLosing Cal we knew we had to step up. We\u2019ve had a couple of good wins in our short history and this marks another one of those,\u201d Coniglio told Fox Footy.\n\u201cThe mids in particular led the charge. Cal was just upbeat the whole time on the bench, had a chat to the boys at three-quarter time. I was really proud of everyone today.\u201d\nPatrick Dangerfield on the bench at GMHBA Stadium. Source: News Corp Australia\nConiglio wasn\u2019t the only star Giant to upstage Geelong\u2019s midfield.\nJosh Kelly returned from injury last week and returned to form on Saturday, collecting 32 disposals in a dominant display, while All-Australian defender Lachie Whitfield continued his roaring start to 2019, finishing with another 31 disposals and 539 metres gained.\nDE BOER DAMAGE\nA week after driving Richmond superstar Dustin Martin to the point of destruction, holding him to just 15 touches in the process, Matt de Boer has done it again.\nThis time it was Tim Kelly who was claimed by the Giants\u2019 veteran, who is challenging West Coast premiership midfielder Mark Hutchings as the best tagger in the game right now.\nAnd this time it was even better than last week.\nThe West Australian star was held to just nine touches and zero impact.\nJeremy Cameron slotted another three goals on Saturday. Source: AAP\nCOLEMAN MEDAL WATCH\nJeremy Cameron arrived in Geelong in serious form after booting 7.5 from 30 touches \u2014 one of his best performances ever \u2014 against Richmond last weekend.\nAnd that didn\u2019t stop at GMHBA Stadium.\nHe didn\u2019t receive too many chances in the first half, but he turned the game in Greater Western Sydney\u2019s in a one-minute patch early in the third quarter, slotting two crucial goals from two special moments.\nCameron finished with three for the day, moving to 17 for the season at the top of the Coleman Medal leaderboard.\nHarrison Himmelberg of the Giants takes a phenomenal mark on Saturday. Source: AAP\nJONATHAN BROWN OR NICK RIEWOLDT EAT YOUR HEART OUT\nWestern Bulldogs defender Hayden Crozier might have taken the biggest mark seen in a long time on Friday night, but Harry Himmelberg took the most courageous we\u2019ve seen in a long time on Saturday.\nIt was reminiscent of Jonathan Brown against Hawthorn at the MCG in 2002 and Nick Riewoldt against Sydney at the SCG in 2004.\nDUSTY LAST WEEK, DANGER THIS WEEK?\nIt didn\u2019t look like there was too much in it, but Geelong superstar Patrick Dangerfield could be looked at for an incident behind the play in the second quarter.\nThe Brownlow Medal favourite appears to make contact with Matt de Boer\u2019s stomach with his elbow, in a blow that sent the Giants\u2019 tagger to ground.\nDangerfield swings his fist backwards a second time and is lucky de Boer is on his way to ground, with his hand grazing the former Docker\u2019s back instead of making contact with his stomach again.\nIt was silly and could prove costly.\nGet the ultimate AFL experience on your phone with the FOX FOOTY App. Download it NOW for FREE on iOS and Android!\nFollow Geelong v GWS Giants in our live blog below.\nIf you

He also said, \u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot from the Taylor Swifts of the world, and top-tier, needle-moving cultural youth, because they are concerned about their brand, their demographic and their success and career and whatnot.\u201d\nAnd there you have it: a celebrity beef between the 50-something industrial rocker and the 20-something pop star.\nFittingly, the easily distracted nature of a society bound for hell is key to the condition that besets the agonized central character of the spellbinding \u201cBad Witch,\u201d a six-song collection that finds grim beauty in fatalism, a sonic mix of chaotic aggression and abject resignation.\nReznor is consumed by the bracing distortion of the opening track as he observes, \u201cI\u2019m becoming something new/It\u2019s getting hard to recognize\u201d \u2013 a thought further delineated in the agitated percolation of the subsequent \u201cAhead of Ourselves,\u201d where he notes, \u201cNot quite as clever as we think we are/Knuckle-dragging animal/When we could have done anything.\u201d He shuts down higher-power salvation, too, on \u201cGod Bread Down the Door\u201d: \u201cYou won\u2019t find the answers here/Not the ones you came looking for.\u201d\nMore:Christina Aguilera basks in 'Liberation' ... until the men show up\nReznor and his co-producer Atticus Ross layer inspiring elements of horn-driven jazz to provide an unlikely complement to the metallic/electronic frenzy, and the \u201cBad Witch\u201d cauldron ultimately simmers down as it achieves potency\u2013 first with the protracted penultimate cut \u201cI\u2019m Not From This World,\u201d an absorbing instrumental that feels like ominous surrender. Then the near-8-minute closing cut, \u201cOver and Out,\u201d ends \u201cBad Witch\u201d in a bleak indulgence in minimalistic ambience and crooning vocals: \u201cTime is running out/I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m waiting for.\u201d\nClearly he can\u2019t just shake it off.\nNine Inch Nails\n\"Bad Witch\"\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n++++++++++\nLykke Li is more bland than sad or sexy\nLykke Li surrenders to the machine on her new \u201cSo Sad So Sexy,\u201d a step back from the offbeat Swedish pop singer\u2019s usual creative twists and a move into a more ambient, mainstream sound.\nIt may be her most subversive ploy yet, though it\u2019s hard to celebrate Li\u2019s exchange of quirky passion in favor of sounding like any other pop singer sucked into the realm of trap-beat-flavored EDM.\nLi\u2019s defeatist attitude here suits her new aesthetic: She\u2019s brooding with the broadest lyrics, complacent to be just another piece in an automated process. The arrangements are half-formed and often sterile, her emotional limbo reflected by songs that sometimes never get to the point.\nVaguely detached and steeped in unspecified melancholy, Li ambles through the half-baked \u201cDeep End,\u201d the flickering simplicity of \u201cJaguars in the Air\u201d and the mopey title track. And when she grimly sings about sleeping nude with no effect on her partner, the noir-tinged \u201cTwo Night\u201d is (perhaps fittingly) unsatisfying.\nThen there\u2019s the wimpy low of \u201cBad Woman,\u201d where she subjugates herself with, \u201cI\u2019ve been a bad woman, but I\u2019m still your woman \u2026 I\u2019ll understand if you leave me.\u201d\nShe shouldn\u2019t make it so tempting to walk away.\nLi does offer reasons to stay, however. The gossamer \u201cUtopia\u201d sounds like an unearthly music box, and the pulsing suggestiveness of \u201cHard Rain\u201d seduces. Also, Li\u2019s on target with \u201cBetter Alone\u2019s\u201d sighing lament, \u201cI\u2019m better alone than lonely,\u201d and she turns her fragility into strength on \u201cLast Piece,\u201d singing, \u201cLet me keep the last piece of my heart before you tear it all apart.\u201d\nBut while \u201cSo Sad So Sexy\u201d has its moments, this Lykke Li makeover is ultimately a reboot no one wanted.\nLykke Li\n\"So Sad So Sexy\"\nRating: 2-1/2 (out of 5)\n++++++++++\nLiz Brasher casts her net for audience\nIn advance of the release of what could be her breakthrough full-length debut album - \u201cPainted Image,\u201d to be released later this year - Liz Brasher sends out the six-track EP \u201cOutcast\u201d that works as an introduction, a teaser and something of a resume.\nThe Memphis-based North Carolina native has a plow-driver voice, her delivery is packed with emotion yet sometimes oddly studied and with a distinct nuance of enunciation. She powers through the diverse set of \u201cOutcast\u201d confidently, seemingly at ease with stylistic shifts from rock to soul to pop.\nYet musically, the material is inconsistent, periodically soft and unmemorable. As a result, Brasher finds herself trying to elevate opening cut \u201cBody of Mine\u201d out of its addled, fuzzy-guitar construction and spike the merely-serviceable groove of \u201cCome My Way\u201d with a bigger than life presence above the distorted crunch.\nFortunately, the arrangements and instrumentation catch up to Brasher\u2019s level, offering fevered garage go-go buzz for the title track, building a subtle cushion for the mournful ballad \u201cRemain\u201d (which opens with the line \u201cI used to build dreams around you \u2026\u201d) and providing alt-pop allure for the swaying melody of \u201cFeel Something,\u201d where she empathetically sings, \u201cAre you the way you are \u2019cause you just wanna feel something?\u201d\n\u201cOutcast\u201d gels at the end with the grandstanding waltz \u201cCold Baby,\u201d a piano-and-strings-backed Brasher embodying something of a hot-blooded, long-suffering Lana Del Rey with lyrics such as, \u201cYou\u2019re a cold baby with a heart made of stone.\u201d\nDespite the early tentativeness, \u201cOutcast\u201d ultimately becomes all about Brasher \u2013 her adaptability, her passion and her voice.

The Rowan County (North Carolina) Sheriff\u2019s Department says he hasn\u2019t done so.\nA Camping World Truck Series truck, owned by fellow NASCAR driver Mike Harmon, according to authorities, was taken to Robert Newling so that Newling could fix damage to it.

That made Bradley\u2019s catch all the more important and could even frame it as a turning point in their season.\nBoston was threatening to waste a dominant effort from ace Chris Sale. The previously struggling left-hander overwhelmed the Orioles on his way to 14 strikeouts. He carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning and recorded an immaculate inning in the seventh.\nSimply put, if Boston lost a game to the worst team in baseball with Sale pitching his best game of the season, it would have been crushing.

Ironically, it was just four days ago that Pillar made a homer-robbing catch that seemed destined to be the best in MLB this season.\nStory continues\nConsidering the effort, the circumstances, the timing and what it could mean to Boston\u2019s season, Bradley\u2019s catch may have already vaulted it.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "sid": 3, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "9981450016527216894", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.news.com.au/sport/golf/ultimate-guide-to-the-2019-us-masters-tournament/news-story/40011da8044a663755c63f423ed21feb", "ms_text": "A__ e___ a__ o_ T____ W____ a__ R___ M______ a_ t___ w___'s M______, w___ J____ D__, A___ S____, M___ L_______ a__ C______ S____ t__ o___ A______ i_ t__ f____.", "full_text": "It\u2019s been six years since Adam Scott sunk a superlative sidewinding putt to beat Argentine Angel Cabrera on the second hole of a playoff and become the first Australian winner of the US Masters.\nSince that time a number of Australians have tried in vain to win the green jacket, with Cameron Smith and Marc Leishman both finishing in the 2018 top 10.\nScott has made the cut every year at Augusta National since his breakthrough win but only the top 10 once, with a tie for ninth in 2017.\nThe 38-year-old Queenslander is looking at once again taking Masters glory for Australia driven by a desire to not simply be a one slam wonder and the \u201cguy who broke the Masters drought for the Aussies.\u201d\nScott says watching replays of his Masters win \u2014 which ended a 77-year wait for Australians at Augusta \u2014 still gives him \u201cchills\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be amazing for me to be a multiple Masters champion and then I might be more than just the guy who broke the drought for the Aussies and become part of Masters history again that way,\u201d Scott said.\nBack in the world top 30, Scott arrives at the first major of the year buoyed by a turn around in his form following a lean 2018.\nScott has had two legitimate chances to win on the US PGA Tour this year \u2014 a runner-up to Justin Rose at Torrey Pines and another strong showing at the recent Players Championship.\nThe 13-time PGA Tour winner says he has ticked every box in his preparation for Augusta this week \u2014 his 18th Masters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nice stretch of preparation; I\u2019ve had some rest and worked plenty on my game since the Players,\u201d Scott said.\n\u201cI did a trip up here for a couple days last week and it definitely got me excited for Masters.\u201d\nIn a year where the Australian contingent is lean on number it is high on quality with Scott joined by Smith, Leishman and former world No. 1 Jason Day, who is adamant his troublesome back is feeling good heading into the first major of the year.\nJason Day lets one rip ahead of the Masters.\n\u201cYeah, the back is feeling good and I\u2019m starting to get excited to get into Masters week and sharpen up,\u201d Day said.\n\u201cThankfully, I\u2019ve got a really good team back home (in Ohio) and it was a matter of being strict with my rehab and resting a lot.\n\u201cWe did a lot of that and the back feels nice.\u201d\nWhile Day has struggled with his back in 2018 and 2019, another man who seems to have overcome his own back issues will be the toast of Augusta National if he breaks his major drought \u2014 Tiger Woods.\nWoods won his last major at the 2009 US Open at Torrey Pines, and his last Masters title in 2005, but up until the back problems he was phenomenal at Augusta, making 11/19 top five performances, including four victories.\nWoods has also made the cut in every tournament he has played in 2019 with his worst finish being a tie for 30th at The Players. The 43-year-old will be every bit the sentimental favourite this week.\nThe actual favourite is Northern Ireland\u2019s Rory McIlroy \u2014 who has won everything but The Masters thus far in his career.

After Karan Johar revealed Madhuri\u2019s first look as Bahaar Begum, people started to draw a lot of comparisons with her Devdas character Chandramukhi.\nHowever, in the same interview to Mid-Day, Madhuri clarified, \u201cBahaar Begum is poles apart from Chandramukhi or anything I have done before. It was a challenge to play her with grace and heart.\u201d\nKalank\u2019s first looks were revealed on March 8. Karan introduced Bahaar Begum as, \u201cEnchanting, ethereal & timeless.

(AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu)\nSay goodbye to the social media roasts and the diss tracks. The playful public jesting in the close friendship between Los Angeles Lakers teammates Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball will be no more after team brass asked the two youngsters to tone it down, per ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne and Ohm Youngmisuk.\nLonzo Ball recently dropped a Kyle Kuzma diss track\nBall and Kuzma are close friends, and like close friends do, they enjoy ribbing one another. The most recent development in this online jesting was Ball\u2019s diss track \u201cKylie Kuzma,\u201d aimed at his fellow Laker.\nThe track included some seemingly deep-cutting lyrics, including some lines that referenced the lack of a relationship between Kuzma and his father. Kuzma\u2019s mother, Karri, chimed in on Twitter shortly after Ball\u2019s song was released.\nEveryone\u2019s had their fun now get back to work. \u2014 #0\ufe0f\u20e3 Kuz Momma (@KarriKuzma) June 13, 2018\nKuzma and Ball\u2019s online spars have included plenty of tweets, Instagram posts and Snapchats that deal with everything from hairstyle to fashion to dietary habits and more. Occasionally other players have joined in, too. But it seems the song was the new development that forced management to step in. Per Shelburne and Youngmisuk, \u201cthe Lakers had grown concerned about the increasingly personal nature of some of the recent roasting between two of their young stars.\u201d\nBoth players agreed to tone down their barbs against one another.\nLakers want to avoid a D\u2019Angelo Russell-esque incident\nIn 2016, the Lakers \u2014 muddled in a lost season \u2014 found themselves in an embarrassing spotlight when D\u2019Angelo Russell filmed Nick Young talking about cheating on his fiancee. The team traded Russell months later, and Young also left the City of Angels following the season. While that incident and this one have no connection, the Lakers\u2019 front office opted to be safe instead of sorry, ending the good-natured ribbing before it could become anything close to a problem.\nStory continues\nThe Lakers have a big summer ahead\nRumors have attached big-name free agents like LeBron James and Paul George to the Lakers. The team has plenty of young, promising talent \u2014 Ball averaged 10.2 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game, and Kuzma, Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram each averaged 16.1 points per game \u2014 and will have the cap room to make some big moves this offseason. To get two of those young players on the same page is an important step as the team hopes to court superstars to the Staples Center.\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\u2022 U.S., Canada, Mexico win bid for 2026 World Cup\n\u2022 Dan Wetzel: Sure, winning World Cup bid is cool, but can U.S. finally win games?\n\u2022 Maryland OL dies days after being hospitalized post-workout\n\u2022 Ice Cube on Kap: \u2018I knew his message would be hijacked\u2019\n", "sid": 4, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "6756005409187926019", "docid": 0, "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4257183/ontario-election-results-2018/", "ms_text": "S___ t___ p___ t_ s______ v__ e____\nS____ t___ i___ o_ T______\nS____ t___ i___ v__ W_______\nV_____ i_ O______ w___ t_ t__ p____ J___ 7 a__ e______ a D___ F___-l__ P_ m_______ g_________.", "full_text": "See more sharing options\nSend this page to someone via email\nShare this item on Twitter\nShare this item via WhatsApp\nShare this item on Facebook\nVoters in Ontario went to the polls June 7 and elected a Doug Ford-led PC majority government.

A major focus for both the Liberals and NDP is providing extended public drug coverage to more or all Ontarians, while the PCs\u2019 big line items are \u201cending hallway medicine\u201d and providing dental care for low-income seniors.\nCHILD CARE & EDUCATION\nWhile the Liberals and New Democrats\u2019 are proposing new child care spaces and offering free care in some cases, Ford is pitching a new tax credit for parents. On education, the PCs have a lot of ideas for primary and secondary schools but the platform makes little mention of post-secondary institutions. Both Wynne and Horwath have made commitments to making university and college education more accessible to students.\nStory continues below advertisement\nJOBS & WAGES\nThe Liberals and NDP have promised to go through with the planned minimum wage increase to $15 an hour and have plans to expand the existing \u2018Jobs and Prosperity\u2019 Fund. The PCs want to go in the opposite direction and have pledged to cancel both that wage hike and the fund.\nTRANSIT & INFRASTRUCTURE\nAll three parties have promised to throw billions of dollars at transit and infrastructure projects in the province, but there are some differences in the details and how they want to go about bringing those projects to fruition.\nStory continues below advertisement\nSOCIAL ASSISTANCE\nThe NDP and Liberals both have plans to continue with the province\u2019s basic income pilot and increase the rates for Ontario Works and the Ontario Disability Support Program. All parties want to build more affordable housing.", "sid": 2, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "87302068922496403", "docid": 0, "url": "https://abc7ny.com/timeline-fatal-shooting-of-nypd-detective-during-robbery-in-queens/5136533/", "ms_text": "R_______ H___, Q_____ (W___) -- N___ D________ B____ S_______, a 1_-y___ v______ o_ t__ f____, w__ k_____ b_ f_______ f___ d_____ a r______ i_ Q_____ T______ n____, a__ S_______ M______ G_____ w__ a___ s_____ b_ g______ b__ i_ e_______ t_ s______.H___ i_ a t_______ o_ e_____ s__________ t__ s_______:P_____ s___ 2_-y___-o__ C__________ R_____ e______ a T-M_____ i_ R_______ H___, Q_____, a__ o______ t__ e________ t_ o___ t__ s___ i_ t__ b___.", "full_text": "TIMELINE: Fatal shooting of NYPD detective during robbery in Queens\nRICHMOND HILL, Queens (WABC) -- NYPD Detective Brian Simonsen, a 19-year veteran of the force, was killed by friendly fire during a robbery in Queens Tuesday night, and Sergeant Matthew Gorman was also struck by gunfire but is expected to survive.\nHere is a timeline of events surrounding the shooting:\nAround 6:00 p.m.:\nPolice said 27-year-old Christopher Ransom entered a T-Mobile in Richmond Hill, Queens, and ordered two employees to open the safe in the back.

Called Apple TV Plus, the offering will feature shows and movies from a host of big-name Hollywood talent ranging from Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg to Reese Witherspoon and Jason Momoa.\nWe got only got a taste of the kind of content we can expect from the service, provided via a mashup of trailers for the various shows announced during the event. And while we found out that Apple TV Plus will be available starting this fall across both Apple devices and third-party smart TVs and streaming players, we are still waiting for the company to announce the service\u2019s most crucial element of all \u2014 its price.\nIf that price hits a sweet spot for consumers, the service could be a certified hit. But if the price comes in too high, it could struggle to fight off established players like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, not to mention upcoming services like Disney\u2019s (DIS) Disney Plus.\nPricing will be key\nWhile Apple debuted its service and gave us a general time frame for its launch, we\u2019re still waiting to learn how much it will cost consumers. A new note from Jefferies suggests that Apple will have \u201climited pricing power given the small content library at launch.\u201d\nCredit: David Foster/Yahoo Finance\nIt may need to undercut its competitors, one of which has started charging consumers more: In January, Netflix (NFLX) raised its price on all three of its plans. The Basic offering went from $7.99 to $8.99, the Standard plan went from $10.99 to $12.99, and the Premium plan went from $13.99 to $15.99.\nHulu, meanwhile, lowered the price on the ad-supported version of its service from $7.99 to $5.99 in January, seemingly in response to Netflix\u2019s price increases. The company\u2019s ad-free version stayed at $11.99 per month. Then there\u2019s Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) Prime Video, which costs $8.99 without an Amazon Prime subscription.\nNetflix may be the best deal among all streaming options; it offers a seemingly endless supply of content that makes its price tag seem almost too good to be true. If Apple\u2019s service is going to compete with its contemporaries, it\u2019s going to have to price it accordingly. If the company charges too much, viewers will opt to stick with Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon.\nStory continues\nApple CEO Tim Cook unveils the company's Apple TV Plus streaming service.\nApple likely already understands this. When it rolled out its Apple Music streaming service in 2015, the company priced it at $9.99 per month and $14.99 for a family plan, the same price as competitor Spotify\u2019s (SPOT) plans.\nSpotify, though, also throws in Hulu\u2019s ad-supported service with its $9.99 plan, but you can all but guarantee that Apple will do the same with its music and video services.\nApple TV Plus is going premium\nOutside of pricing, Apple\u2019s streaming TV service looks as though it will differ from its competitors in one major way. While those companies \u2014 Netflix in particular \u2014seemingly throw money at any script that comes their way, Apple looks like it\u2019s going to be taking a more deliberate approach to selecting the kinds of movies and TV shows it funds.\nNone of the content we saw at the company\u2019s event looked like it was made for viewing during hour 12 of a 15-hour binge session on a rainy Saturday afternoon. And based on the Hollywood talent working on them, Apple\u2019s shows and movies have the makings of legitimately exciting content that could draw in viewers and keep them over the long term. We\u2019re talking about top-tier shows on a par with Netflix\u2019s more culturally significant offerings.\nOprah Winfrey debuts two documentaries she is working on with Apple TV Plus. (image: Apple)\nThat said, what we saw was only a hint of what the final products will turn into. And there\u2019s no telling whether any of the series or movies will turn out to be genuine hits. What\u2019s more, the reported $1 billion Apple spent on its content is only a fraction of the $12 billion Netflix spent on content in 2018 alone. And that number is only expected to grow, with Variety reporting that Netflix will spend a whopping $15 billion on shows and movies in 2019.\nApple has a built-in advantage in the streaming market, though. Its service will be a part of its Apple TV app, which is already available on more than 1 billion active devices around the world. That means Apple won\u2019t have to coax customers into downloading its app like competitors have to.\nStill, as Loup Ventures\u2019 Gene Munster points out in a new note, Apple won\u2019t see huge subscriber numbers overnight.\n\u201cIt will take a long time for Apple to establish an association with the activity of watching long-form content (as Netflix has done), but Apple has made it clear that the company is serious about original content,\u201d Munster wrote.\nSteve Carell, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston talk about their Apple TV Plus show called \"The Morning Show.\" (image: Apple)\nWith so many streaming services coming to market, though, and only so many dollars for consumers to spend each month on subscriptions, Apple is going to have to ensure that its content stands apart from its competitors\u2019. We\u2019ll find out if that\u2019s the case later this fall.\nMore from Dan:\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at@DanielHowley.

Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a \"hunting\" enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving. Getty Where not to visit if you love animals Running of the Bulls Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town's narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs.

The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. Getty Where not to visit if you love animals Zoos The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there's nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further.

Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving. Getty Where not to visit if you love animals Running of the Bulls Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls.

Some analysts viewed him as having the highest ceiling of any prospect in this draft, but his development at the NBA level could take time.\nIt will present an interesting dynamic given Grizzlies owner Robert Pera\u2019s hopes that the team will win more than 50 games next season with aging stars Mike Conley and Marc Gasol back in the fold.\n2018 NBA Draft: Social media reacts to Grizzlies taking Jaren Jackson Jr.\n\"I definitely want to come in and do whatever it takes to win, but at the same time I know that I\u2019m young and I think that there\u2019s always growing to go,\" said Jackson, who is the highest NBA draft pick out of Michigan State since Magic Johnson.\n\"Every player has to go through a lot of growing curves and I think with the vets they got there, it\u2019ll help me speed up the process because you got a guy like Marc Gasol who can give me the ins and outs of being a big and you\u2019re playing with a point guard like Mike Conley, who\u2019s just ridiculous. He\u2019s just ridiculous. He\u2019s so smart. I\u2019ve been watching him play for years, and they\u2019re established.\"\nIn Memphis, a buzz filtered through FedExForum Thursday night during the moments before the Grizzlies were on the clock in the first round.\nOn the Jumbotron, ESPN had just announced a trade between the Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas would get Slovenian sensation Luka Doncic. Atlanta would receive Oklahoma star Trae Young. But the deal would only work if the status quo prevailed and Young remained available at No. 5.\nThe Grizzlies ultimately obliged, choosing Jackson to a mixture of cheers and jeers from the fans at FedExForum who aren't sure exactly how this draft pick will fit in with the franchise's current trajectory.\n2018 NBA draft tracker:Pick-by-pick analysis, grades for each selection\n\"I\u2019m just trying to come in and extend the culture they\u2019ve already set,\" Jackson said. \"I think the unique thing about Memphis aside from other teams is we have a unique mix of a bunch of different things. You have a new coach, mixed with veteran players, mixed with young players who are just as excited to be there. So there\u2019s a lot of people who can teach you, a lot of new things you can learn, as well as a winning culture with the front office, that wants to be the best team in the Western Conference.\"\nAdded Wallace, who envisions Jackson playing at power forward and center initially: \"Because he\u2019s a young colt type of guy and got so much upside and room to grow doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t give you something right now.\"\nIn New York, Jackson walked the stage and shook NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s hand wearing a dapper pink crushed velvet jacket. He then conducted an interview with ESPN alongside his parents.\nJaren Jackson Sr. played 12 seasons in the NBA with nine different teams and won an NBA championship with the Spurs in 1999, the same year Jaren Jackson Jr. was born. Jackson\u2019s mother, Terri, is currently the director of operations for the WNBA\u2019s Players\u2019 Association.\nBoth parents flashed their championship ring from 1999 to the TV cameras.\nJackson, meanwhile, flashed his engaging personality and made it easy to forget the pre-draft rumblings suggesting he didn't want to be selected by the the Grizzlies.\nIn recent days, reports emerged that Jackson wouldn't share his medical records with the Grizzlies and hoped to avoid Memphis. On Thursday night, Jackson insisted those rumors were \"a tad out of context,\" and that scheduling conflicts led him to not work out for the team before the draft.\nRelated:Biggest winners and losers of 2018 NBA draft\nWallace confirmed the team received trade offers for its draft picks, but ultimately decided none were worth pursuing with Jackson and Carter still on the board.\nInstead, Jackson said he received a phone call from Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff in the middle of his media obligations Wednesday in New York and it appears to have convinced him the Grizzlies were a better fit than he initially thought.\nAnd so as he walked off the Barclays Center stage in Brooklyn, Jackson was shown on camera singing lyrics from Memphis rapper BlocBoy JB's song, \"Shoot.\" He later shouted out Yo Gotti and Young Dolph, noting he planned to listen to them back at his hotel and on the plane ride to his new home Friday morning.\n\"I was happy to go anywhere,\" Jackson said, \"but definitely when you sit down and think about it and think about the team, take a deep breath and exhale, I\u2019m actually glad it was Memphis.\"", "sid": 7, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "8208594809301946418", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/2018/06/21/jaren-jackson-jr-memphis-grizzlies/710423002/", "ms_text": "C____\nM_______ S____'s J____ J______ J_. p____ w___ N__ c___________ A___ S_____ a____ h_ w__ p_____ f_____ o______ b_ t__ M______ G________ d_____ t__ N__ d____ i_ N__ Y___, T_______, J___ 2_, 2___.", "full_text": "Michigan State's Jaren Jackson Jr. has been selected No. 4 overall by the Memphis Grizzlies in Thursday's 2018 NBA draft.

The Mangaldoi constituency, which was voting in a bypoll after the death of its MP Hiralal Patwari, was under the spotlight. The seat, with a very high concentration of immigrants from East Bengal, drew national attention due to a sudden rise in the number of voters compared to the previous election two years earlier. Even as reports suggested a large-scale immigration from Bangladesh into the state, on June 8, 1979, the All Assam Students Union went on a 12-hour general strike demanding the \u2018detention, disenfranchisement and deportation\u2019 of all foreigners. What followed in the next few months and years was a spree of protest movements, several rounds of negotiations with the government and ultimately the signing of the Assam accord in 1985 that listed down a number of measures to be taken for the state to deal with the issue of immigration.\nAlso read: 40 lakh not in register cannot be called illegal, says Assam official behind NRC\nIt has taken 33 years for this crucial piece of the Assam Accord to finally fall into place. On Monday, when the final draft of the National Register of Citizens was released, close to 40 lakh residents of Assam were disappointed to find their names missing from the list. With the Opposition, especially West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slamming the move, BJP president Amit Shah reminded everyone that the accord was signed in 1985 under the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government.\n\u201cRajiv Gandhi signed the Assam Accord in 1985, which was similar to NRC. They did not have the courage to implement it, we did,\u201d he said in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.\nWhat was the Assam movement?\nThe issue of immigration had rankled ethnic relations in Assam since the years preceding Independence. American political scientist Myron Weiner, carrying out a census study in Assam, had noted \u2013 based on the projection of the 1891 census \u2013 that immigrants and their descendants would then number 8.5 million as opposed to locals and their descendants at 6.5 million. However, after free India was born the issue was brushed under the carpet until 1979, when the Assam movement began. What kept the immigration issue at bay was the centrality of language issue in defining the boundaries of ethnic conflicts for a long time.\nAlso read: NRC poses a political and moral question\nWhile the immigration issue did come up once in a while, it was only in 1979 that it shook the state, defining the contours of ethnic and religious relations for years to come. \u201cIt ruptured carefully nurtured ethnic coalitions that were at the foundation of political stability in the state, setting the stage for a prolonged period of political turmoil,\u201d writes political scientist Sanjib Baruah in his article \u2018Immigration, ethnic conflict and political turmoil- Assam 1979-1985\u2019.\nThe 12-hour strike of June 8 was soon followed by the formation of the Assam Gana Sangam Parishad (AGSP) for conducting a coordinated statewide movement.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAn unprecedented mass popular upsurge followed in the form of sit-ins, picketings in front of government offices, strikes, and symbolic disobedience of the law,\u201d writes Baruah.\nBetween 1980 and 1982, close to 23 rounds of negotiations took place between the movement\u2019s leaders and the central government. Even though the Assam movement had sufficient support, there were many against it as well, considering the size of the immigrant population in Assam and the political cost of agreeing to the demands of the movement.\nBy the end of 1982, however, an agreement was reached between the Centre and the movement\u2019s leaders that all those who made it within the Indian borders between 1951 and 1961 would be given citizenship status, while those who came after 1971 would be deported. But the status of those who entered between 1961 and 1971 was not resolved.\nAdvertisement\nAlso, there was no agreement on the procedures to be used in order to conclude the status of a resident. In the meantime, the movement had gained sufficient momentum to be able to disrupt the functioning of the government including the 1980 parliamentary elections, and the Assembly elections of 1983.\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Home Minister S.B.

Chavan with a delegation of Assam Gan Prishad leader headed by Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and Bhrigu Kumar Phukan (Express archive photo)\nNegotiations between the movement\u2019s leaders and the central government were once again initiated in 1984. By this time the Janata Party was no longer in power, and the government lay in the hands of Rajiv Gandhi. Consequently, an accord was signed on August 15, 1985, according to which, all illegal aliens who entered the state between January 1966 and March 1971 would be disenfranchised for 10 years, and those who came after March 1971 would be deported. Once the accord was signed, the state government was dissolved as fresh elections were held based on revised electoral rolls in December 1985.\nWhat is the Assam Accord?\nThe Assam Accord of 1985 began with the assurance that the \u201cgovernment has all along been most anxious to find a satisfactory resolution to the problem of foreigners in Assam.\u201d Consequently, it put together a list of resolutions to be implemented in order to solve the immigration issue in Assam.\nAs per the accord, all people who came to Assam prior to January 1, 1966, would be given citizenship. Those who moved in between January 1, 1966, and March 24, 1971, would be \u201cdetected in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order 1964\u201d. Their names would be deleted from the electoral rolls and they would remain disenfranchised for a period of 10 years. Lastly, the accord provided a resolution to the case of those who entered Indian borders after March 24, 1971.\n\u201cForeigners who came to Assam on or after March 25, 1971, shall continue to be detected, deleted and practical steps shall be taken to expel such foreigners,\u201d said the accord.\nAdvertisement\nThe signing of the accord ensured that the agitation came to an end. However, several clauses mentioned in it are yet to be implemented, and that in turn has kept the issue burning along ethnic, religious and geographical lines for the last three decades.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "2312274369090210138", "docid": 0, "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/396536-house-passes-resolution-in-support-of-nato-by-unanimous-voice-vote", "ms_text": "T__ H____ o_ W________ u__________ p_____ a r_________ e_________ s______ f__ N___ a_ P________ T____ D_____ J___ T__________: D_________ p___________ 'n__________,' 'c____ n__ f_____ i_' B_____ t___ B___ h_ w__ c________ T____ d__ f_____ f__ a________: r_____ D_________: B_____ a__________ w____ n__ c_________ i__________ o______ M___ r_____ a_____ w___ e_________ c____ f__ i________ s_______ f___ a_______ m______.", "full_text": "The House on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution expressing support for NATO as President Trump roiled allies with escalating calls for increased spending from alliance members.\nThe House, which added the NATO resolution to its schedule this week, approved the item via voice vote, according to multiple reports.

Not so much. A ballet of black and beige with washed-out shades of blue and gray and a couple of unicorn-rare pops of bright accent color, the collection was heavy on the apr\u00e8s-danse look \u2014 easy, breezy comfortable pieces wrapped and draped across the body, mesh layered over bodysuits, and the kind of simple tank tops, airy skirts and heavy coats a professional dancer might throw on before dashing from a stage door to a waiting car.\nAdvertisement\nLooks from the spring and summer 2019 Dior runway show, which was presented Monday. (Francois Guillot / AFP / Getty Images)\nThe backstage bunhead vibe was heightened by the collection\u2019s standout shoe silhouette: a ballet-slipper-like shoe with a transparent Plexiglass heel and ribbon braiding that crisscrossed up the ankle.\nThe collection also included a range of sharp and smartly belted blazers that have been a runway staple the last several seasons \u2014 some in navy blue and others in beige \u2014 as well as an assortment of tulle dresses with faded floral embroidery and a handful of dashiki-like tops sporting the collection\u2019s few pops of bright color, including yellow and purple.\nA washed-out kaleidoscopic motif meets tie-dye pattern was, almost by default, the most eye-catching pattern in the mix, turning up on baggy denim cargo pants and trousers, tulle skirts and kimono-like robes and a few pieces that melded it with out-size florals, resulting in a trippy, \u201970s-infused festival look that is all but guaranteed to turn up in the VIP wristband section at Coachella.\nadam.tschorn@latimes.com\nFor more musings on all things fashion and style, follow me at @ARTschorn", "sid": 7, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "14896019881740988252", "docid": 0, "url": "https://kotaku.com/your-apex-legends-character-might-be-the-reason-you-kee-1832844104", "ms_text": "S_________ : R______/E_\nH___ y__ b___ p______ a l__ o_ A___ L______, b__ j___ c__\u2019t s___ t_ g__ a w__?", "full_text": "Have you been playing a lot of Apex Legends, but just can\u2019t seem to get a win?

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Suspect Cesar Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts shop in the city of Plantation, Florida this morning.\nSayoc\u2019s white van was covered in stickers celebrating Republicans and denouncing the president\u2019s opponents.\nThe suspect was charged with five offenses, including threats against former presidents, mailing explosives, and assaulting current and former federal officers.\nThirteen devices were mentioned in a federal criminal complaint.\nA 14th device was reported by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\nA single fingerprint left on a package posted to a Democratic congresswoman was crucial to ending the manhunt.\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general, said of Sayoc, \u201cHe appears to be a partisan.\u201d\nSayoc was born in Brooklyn and registered as a Republican in 2016, according to public records.\nHis social media accounts contain photographs and video clips in which he is wearing Trump\u2019s red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.\nTrump called for \u201ccivility\u201d, but then attacked the media, encouraged chants of \u201cCNN sucks\u201d and \u201clock her up\u201d.\nTrump supporters in North Carolina said they suspected the attacks were part of a \u201cliberal hoax\u201d despite the FBI saying they were \u201cnot hoax devices\u201d.\n26 Oct 2018 00.57 BST Minutes after calling for civility, Trump has attacked Hillary Clinton, overseeing a \u201clock her up\u201d chant: Well, at this NC rally, Trump's back to knocking \"Crooked Hillary\" and encouraging chants of \"Lock Her Up.\"\n\"Oh, boy, they're going to be reporting about you tonight,\" he tells the mob, err, crowd.\nHis restraint about blasting the pipe-bomb targets lasted one rally. \u2014 Jackie Calmes (@jackiekcalmes) October 26, 2018\n26 Oct 2018 00.51 BST Trump has moved on from discussing the pipe bombs and returned to his rally talking points. He said little of the suspect. It\u2019s worth noting that, contrary to Trump\u2019s claims that the right does not blame Democrats for \u201cleftist ... violence\u201d, the president has recently sought to link the Democratic party to anti-fascists and \u201cantifa\u201d. In August, during a private meeting with Christian ministers, Trump said if Republicans lose Congress, congressional Democrats \u201cwill end everything immediately\u201d. He continued, \u201cThey will overturn everything that we\u2019ve done and they\u2019ll do it quickly and violently. And violently. There\u2019s violence.

That shooter was reportedly a supporter of Bernie Sanders: \"When a Bernie Sanders supporter tried to murder congressional Republicans,\" POTUS said, \"We did not use that heinous attempt at mass murder for political gain because that would've been wrong.\" \u2014 Katie Rogers (@katierogers) October 26, 2018 Trump further claimed that he does not \u201cblame the Democrat Party\u201d when \u201cradical leftists seize and destroy public property\u201d. \"Nor do we blame the Democrat Party every time radical leftists seize and destroy public property and unleash violence and mayhem.

Everyone will benefit if we can end the politics of personal destruction. We must unify as a nation in peace, love and harmony. The media has a major role to play whether they want to or not. They have a major role to play, as far as tone, and as far as everything. The president went on to criticize the media\u2019s \u201cconstant unfair coverage, deep hostility and negative attacks\u201d, claiming that they \u201conly serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate\u201d. He said the media was exploiting the pipe bombs to \u201cscore political points against me\u201d and Republicans. He continued, \u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement. ... Our supporters are some of the most honest, wonderful ... principled hardworking patriotic people on the face of God\u2019s earth.\u201d\n26 Oct 2018 00.25 BST Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage. Trump is speaking now at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is addressing the 13 suspected pipe bombs sent to his critics: The suspect has been captured, great job, and is now in federal custody. These terrorist actions must be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. We all know that. I want to applaud the FBI and Secret Service ... They did an incredible job. This is finding truly a needle in the haystack, when you think about it. We love our police and we love our law enforcement. Political violence must never ever be allowed in America and I will do everything in my power to stop it.\n26 Oct 2018 23.45 BST Guardian reporter Jon Swaine noted this afternoon that Syoc\u2019s Twitter accounts have now been suspended.

The incident/investigation report submitted by Officer C Salerno lists more than $44,000 in property that Sayoc claimed had been taken from his parked Dodge Ram SUV and an attached U-Haul trailer shortly after midnight on 12 May 2015 when it was parked in Oakland Park, Florida. The Trump items, listed under \u201cclothing/furs\u201d and detailed as \u201cdress suits\u201d were not even the most expensive: Sayoc told detectives that Tasso items worth $9,600 and Boss items at $7,650 were also swiped along with office equipment, computers and miscellaneous household appliances. It is not known if anyone was ever arrested for the alleged crime or if Sayoc received an insurance payout. Meanwhile, the same batch of documents from the Broward sheriff\u2019s department includes a series of other mugshots of Sayoc from five separate arrests between 2004 and 2015.\n26 Oct 2018 23.13 BST Ed Pilkington Our Ed Pilkington is in Charlotte North Carolina where Trump supporters have been lining up all day in a driving rain to see the president speak at a midterm campaign rally this evening. The attitude among the crowd there regarding today\u2019s arrest? Paranoia over the whole episode being a hoax or \u201cset-up\u201d, despite all that\u2019s been revealed about Sayoc. Kathy Chenette, 62, a realtor from Mooresville, North Carolina, said she had read on Twitter that the same configuration of stickers on the back of the van had been photographed on the side of the van. \u201cThis was obviously Photoshopped,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a distraction against the invasion of illegal immigrants at the border. It\u2019s all set up by Soros.\u201d George Soros, the billionaire financier, activist and philanthropist, was one of those who had a bomb mailed to his address. In the criminal complaint, prosecutors alleged that comments critical of Soros were posted on Wednesday on a Twitter account believed to be used by Sayoc. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know,\u201d said Tyler Yelton, 43, who works as a landscaper. \u201cMaybe he bought the van already with the stickers on it, or maybe this whole thing is a setup.\u201d Read more from Charlotte below: 'I bet $500 they are lying': Trump fans sceptical about pipe bomb arrest Read more\nUpdated at 23.14 BST\n26 Oct 2018 23.00 BST We\u2019ve got Richard Luscombe in Plantation, Florida, where bomb plot suspect Sayoc was arrested earlier today with this: Mechanic Junior Herrera told the Guardian that Cesar Sayoc did not work at the Autozone store in Plantation where he was arrested, but was a regular customer there and would sometimes sleep outside overnight in his van. \u201cI passed by one day at midnight and his van was parked out the back. It was kind of awkward,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the workers here know him. He used to come in and out buying stuff all the time. Pretty quiet guy, but weird looking. The van was the sign, it was kind of weird. Stuff like, \u2018Thank God we have a president with balls\u2019 on the side. \u201cBut he never spoke about anything political, he was always talking about car parts, you know, and \u2018how do I fix this?\u2019\u201d Herrera added that Sayoc was very secretive about his van. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let you look inside, not even a peek. I helped him change the oil once, it was just \u2018hey, I need this done\u2019 and open the hood.\u2019\u201d Last week, Herrera said, Sayoc had bought a large quantity of vehicle liquids from the store, including starting fluids and brake cleaners. \u201cHe carried them all out in a bag. They\u2019re all chemicals, gasoline or petroleum based and flammable,\u201d he said.\nUpdated at 23.09 BST", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "9160559870088440538", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/26/suspicious-package-pipe-bombs-latest-found-cory-booker-florida", "ms_text": "'I b__ $5__ t___ a__ l____': T____ f___ s________ a____ p___ b___ a_____ R___ m___\nC____ S____ w__ a_______ a_ a_ a___ p____ s___ i_ t__ c___ o_ P_________ o_ F_____ m______.", "full_text": "An avowed Donald Trump supporter in southern Florida was charged on Friday with sending pipe bombs to critics of the president, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThirteen of the devices were mentioned on a federal criminal complaint. A 14th device was reported by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\nCesar Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts shop in the city of Plantation on Friday morning. His white van, which was covered in stickers celebrating Republicans and denouncing the president\u2019s opponents, was parked outside.\nSayoc, 56, has an address in the Miami suburb of Aventura and an extensive arrest record. According to his social media accounts, he works as a booking agent for a live events company and is a former wrestler and cage fighter.\nSayoc in his booking photo. Photograph: Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office/EPA\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general, said at a press conference in Washington Sayoc had been charged with five offences including threats against former presidents, assaulting current and former federal officers and mailing explosives. The charges were filed to federal court in Manhattan.\n\u201cLet this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats, intimidation and outright violence to further an agenda,\u201d Sessions said.\nAsked why most of Sayoc\u2019s alleged targets were Democrats, Sessions said: \u201cHe appears to be a partisan.\u201d A court filing said the stickers covering Sayoc\u2019s van included \u201cimages critical of CNN\u201d, the TV station frequently derided by Trump, whose New York studios were the target of two bombs.\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump praised the \u201cincredible job\u201d done by investigators and promised to punish the person responsible. Speaking later at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump won applause from his loyalist supporters for calling for national unity and an end to political violence. But he soon attacked the media, encouraged chants of \u201cCNN sucks\u201d and set the audience up to boo the Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and reprise \u201clock her up\u201d chants aimed at Hillary Clinton.\nFBI director Christopher Wray said Sayoc had been linked by a fingerprint to a package sent to the California congresswoman Maxine Waters. DNA possibly from Sayoc was also found in one of the packages, Wray said, stressing that they contained authentic explosives.\n\u201cThese are not hoax devices,\u201d Wray said, adding that more could yet be in the mail.\nThree bombs were confirmed by authorities when charges were brought, bringing to 13 the number known to have been sent. None exploded before being found and no injuries were reported.\nThe packages found on Friday were sent to two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California; to James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence. Steyer, a donor to Democratic groups, said an additional suspect package addressed to him was intercepted in Burlingame, California.\nSign up for the new US morning briefing\nSayoc was born in Brooklyn, New York, and registered as a Republican in 2016, according to public records. His social media accounts contain photographs and video clips in which he is wearing Trump\u2019s signature red baseball cap with the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d.\nThe 56-year-old has also posted material online denigrating Muslims and raising popular rightwing conspiracy theories including the false claim that Clinton killed a former deputy White House counsel, Vince Foster.\nHe threatened CNN in a tweet in August. Rochelle Ritchie, a former aide to Democratic politicians, said on Friday she reported Sayoc to Twitter earlier this year after he warned her: \u201cHug your loved ones real close every time you leave you home.\u201d Twitter told her Sayoc had not violated its rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.\nSayoc\u2019s arrest record stretches back more than 25 years and includes charges for theft, battery, domestic violence and other offences. In August 2002, he was found guilty of making a bomb threat to a utilities worker.\nDaniel Lurvey, an attorney who represented Sayoc in some of his criminal cases, said Sayoc had been \u201cnormal and courteous\u201d and did not seem politically angry. \u201cI think it\u2019s a recent phenomenon that\u2019s happening to a lot of people who have feelings under the surface that are brought out by this divisive political climate,\u201d said Lurvey.\nOn Friday afternoon, police and security guards were blocking off an upmarket 27-story condominium block in Aventura, where Sayoc has been listed as a resident.\nNeighbours said they were surprised. But one, Dan Ochsenschlagen, said there had been friction on the condominium board between Sayoc\u2019s mother, the registered owner of the apartment, and other board members. Ochsenschlagen said Sayoc\u2019s mother, who often made political statements, was president of the board for 17 years until she was voted out last December.\n\u201cSome of the things that were going on were very questionable,\u201d Ochsenschlagen said. He said he had reported what he called \u201cfinancial irregularities\u201d to police in Miami. The Guardian was not immediately able to verify the claims.\nAuthorities hoped Sayoc\u2019s arrest would end the steady discovery of more matching envelopes, containing what appeared to be pipes packed with explosives and connected to wires, across the US. The criminal complaint against Sayoc said the packages included photographs of the targets\u2019 faces that had been crossed out with a red \u201cX\u201d.\nThe first package was discovered on Monday in a mailbox at the New York home of George Soros, a wealthy liberal donor. It was followed by similar packages intercepted by the secret service that were addressed to the homes of Obama and Clinton.\nOver the following days packages were found addressed to former vice-president Joe Biden, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, Waters and the actor Robert De Niro. All are high-profile opponents of Trump.\nThe package addressed to Booker was intercepted in Florida while the one for Clapper was discovered at a post office in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan. It was addressed to Clapper at the offices of CNN, a few blocks away, where he is employed as an analyst.\nAnyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions James Clapper\nCNN\u2019s Manhattan offices were evacuated on Wednesday when another suspected pipe bomb was sent there, meant for Brennan. Both former intelligence officials have been outspoken critics of Trump\u2019s actions in office. Clapper on Friday said the packages were part of campaign of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d intended to sow fear.\n\u201cThis is not going to silence the administration\u2019s critics,\u201d Clapper told CNN. \u201cBut anyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions particularly with respect to mail.\u201d\nClapper praised the FBI for its work and for persevering in the face of abuse from the president. Trump has accused the FBI of being involved in a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy to undermine him and of botching an inquiry into a private email server used by Clinton. \u201cWill the FBI ever recover its once stellar reputation?\u201d he asked in a tweet in August.\nShortly before the arrest, Trump complained that the attempted bombings were damaging his party\u2019s prospects for next month\u2019s midterm elections. He also appeared to stoke conspiracy theories.\n\u201cRepublicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this \u2018Bomb\u2019 stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows \u2013 news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!\u201d, Trump said. The president had also complained in a 3am tweet he was being unfairly blamed for the attempted bombings.\nThe governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said Trump\u2019s reaction was \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d and showed he had \u201cnever fully made the transition\u201d to being presidential. \u201cAm I hopeful that the zebra changes his or her stripes today? No,\u201d Cuomo said on CNN.\nSupporters of Trump speculated without evidence that the devices were not viable and could not have harmed people. Cuomo said: \u201cNo one can say that they were fake bombs. These were dangerous devices that could explode.\u201d\nDe Niro made his first remarks on the pipe bomb discovered at his offices in lower Manhattan. \u201cI thank God no one\u2019s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something more powerful than bombs, and that\u2019s your vote.

At 19-all, Tai made two uncharacteristic errors which put the shuttle beyond the side line to help Sindhu pocket the second game and push the match into the decider at the Axiata Arena.\nThe defending champion completely upped the ante in the deciding game as Sindhu proved no match for the World No.1.

His smashes had power and precision to make life difficult for Srikanth.\nSrikanth and Momota went neck-and-neck from 3-3 to 5-5 before the Japanese rode on his deception and better court coverage to open up a 10-7 lead. Srikanth won a good rally but the Japanese had his nose ahead at the break when Srikanth was bamboozled by a tight net shot.\nThe left-handed Japanese produced some superb shots from the back of the court to move to a 13-8 lead. Momota continued to accumulate points, surging to 17-12 thereafter.\nSrikanth misjudged a shot at the back line to hand over game points to Momota, who sealed it with another precise net shot.\nREAD | PV Sindhu, Kidambi Srikanth make positive starts at Malaysia Open badminton\nWith Momota in full flow, the margin for error was miniscule and the Japanese pounced on every opportunity to lead 5-1 after the change of sides.\nSrikanth built the rallies well but often erred with the length and miscued strokes as Momota moved into the breather at 11-5. The Japanese continued to rule the roost and quickly moved to seven match points when Srikanth found the net.

We needed to firm up alliances,\u201d one of the BJP leaders said. \u201cWe ceded space to allies such as the Janata Dal (United), buried differences with the Shiv Sena, and kept our ambitions under check in Tamil Nadu to forge alliances that can help us return to power.\u201d\nAlso read| \u2018Not helpless, gave it another shot\u2019, Shiv Sena on alliance with BJP\nThe Bihar deal is the oldest, and was struck in December 2018. The BJP\u2019s deals with the Sena in Maharashtra and the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu were finalised earlier this week.\nThe BJP has now turned its attention to other states.\n\u201cOur alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab remains intact and there is no major issue over number of seats we will contest,\u201d the BJP leader added. Of the 13 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab, the Akalis got 10 to contest in the last election and the BJP 3. \u201cThe numbers will remain the same,\u201d a second BJP leader said. The party may also cede a seat or two to alliance partners in Jharkhand, where all opposition parties have joined hands, the second leader added.\nThe BJP\u2019s Kerala unit is in talks with the Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena, an outfit with following among the OBC Ezhava community. \u201cThey want about half a dozen seats and discussions are on,\u201d a third BJP? leader said. \u201cThe BJP may also support a couple of independent candidates in the state.\u201d Kerala has 20 Lok Sabha seats and despite fielding candidates in 18 in the last parliamentary election, the party could not win even a single seat .\nThe BJP continues to flirt with actor-politician Pawan Kalyan (of the Jana Sena) in Andhra Pradesh, but he continues to remain non-commital.\nThe party has, meanwhile, suffered a setback in the North-east with the Asom Gana Parishad walking out of the National Democratic Alliance over the citizenship amendment bill, which intends to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The BJP was relieved after the Bodo People\u2019s Front, another ally from Assam, decided to remain with the NDA, but 11 other regional parties gave it the jitters by openly opposing the proposed law.\n\u201cWe did not press for the passage of the bill in the Rajya Sabha and we hope this will help assuage the feeling of other allies. They are certainly not supporting the Congress. We are hopeful they will stay with us and help win 20 out of 25 seats of the North-east,\u201d a fourth BJP leader said. The BJP won 8 out of the 25 Lok Sabha seat in eight states in the region in 2014 and was looking to offset some of the losses it will suffer in the Hindi heartland here. BJP won 71 out of 80 in UP, 22 out of 40 in Bihar, 27 out of 29 in Bihar, 10 out of 11 in Chhattisgarh, 12 out of 14 in Jharkhand and all 25 in Rajasthan.\n\u201cThe citizenship bill has brought parties in the region together and has given them more bargaining power with the BJP . Whether these parties will continue their alliance with it depends a lot on how Narendra Modi and Amit Shah work in coming days\u201d said H Srikanth, head of political science department in North Eastern Hill University, Shillong.\nAlso read| \u2018Agreed to alliance as BJP\u2019s way of treating allies has changed\u2019: Uddhav Thackeray\nA senior cabinet minister said the BJP also expects gains in Odisha, Telangana and West Bengal \u2013three states where it is pitted against regional players and has worked tirelessly to expand its presence in the last five years.\nThe first BJP leader said there\u2019s also the issue of fine-tuning the seat sharing arrangement in Bihar. The BJP and the JD(U) have decided to contest 17 seats each, leaving 6 for the Lok Janshakti Party of Ram Vilas Paswan. \u201cSince JD(U) contested separately in the last election, there is some overlapping of seats both of us want to contest,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 4-5 seats which are yet to be sorted out.\u201d\nDM Diwakar, a social scientist at AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, said, \u201cIt (the seat-sharing deal) is victory of JD(U), and also indicates that BJP is getting weak. The BJP was desperate not to lose the JD (U).\u201d\nAnalysts say the AIADMK and BJP alliance in Tamil Nadu is a marriage of convenience and makes overt what was till now a covert relationship. The induction of a powerful regional ally like AIADMK though signals that NDA continues to be an attractive front , they add.With the absence of a charismatic leader, AIADMK is rudderless but retains a very large vote base nurtured over decades and BJP will be hoping to cash in on that.\nThis is specially so as BJP has had very little success in the Dravidan bastion.\nAccording to G Palanithurai, Professor, Gandhigram Rural University, there are some question marks over the alliance. \u201cCan the AIADMK retain its own vote base and transfer it to its partners BJP and PMK where required? Can the partners smoothly sort out issues like identifying constituencies?\u201d\nC Lakshmanan, Associate Professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) says this alliance will consolidate OBC votes but lose scheduled caste and minority ones.\nThe alliance in Maharashtra also comes at a political cost for the BJP as it had to concede almost equal status to the Shiv Sena in the assembly even after it won 122 seats in 2014 as compared to Sena\u2019s 63.\nAlso read| Saffron allies see red, barbs fly day after polls deal\nThe tie up also includes a power sharing agreement wherein the partners will share equally posts and responsibilities, if they win power in the state. The Sena says this refers to the chief minister\u2019s post, while the BJP denies it.\nThe turn around or the \u201cfresh start\u201d as Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray called it, reflects changing ground realities for both the parties.\n\u201cThe BJP is aware that the Modi wave has receded and in the face of a united opposition, it will need the Sena ,\u201d said Prakash Bal, political analyst.\nAlso

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) told reporters that officials with Mazars USA requested a compulsory measure before it could consider accommodating the panel\u2019s document request for information related to Trump\u2019s finances.\nFor more than a decade, Mazars and a predecessor firm signed off on financial statements for Trump that he used when seeking loans. Some of the statements include frequent exaggerations or inaccuracies and were accompanied by a note from the firm saying it was not responsible for the accuracy of the information.\nThe committee on March 20 asked the company for copies of \u201cstatements of financial condition\u201d and audits prepared for Trump and several of his companies, including the one that owns the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. The panel also requested supporting documents used to produce the reports and communications between the firm and Trump.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe accounting firm told us that they will respond and they just want a subpoena so we . . . we\u2019ve got to figure out how to accommodate them,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cBut apparently it would mean a friendly subpoena, I assume.\u201d\nThe Oversight Committee did not respond to a request for comment or clarification about whether the company planned to turn over all of what was requested.\nA company spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a March 27 letter responding to the committee, shared with The Washington Post, Mazars officials laid out rules and laws barring them from handing out client information without a \u201cvalidly issued and enforceable subpoena.\u201d\n\u201cAs I am sure you can appreciate, Mazars cannot voluntarily turn over the documents sought in the request,\u201d wrote Jerry D.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) told reporters that officials with Mazars USA requested a compulsory measure before it could consider accommodating the panel\u2019s document request for information related to Trump\u2019s finances.\nFor more than a decade, Mazars and a predecessor firm signed off on financial statements for Trump that he used when seeking loans. Some of the statements include frequent exaggerations or inaccuracies and were accompanied by a note from the firm saying it was not responsible for the accuracy of the information.\nThe committee on March 20 asked the company for copies of \u201cstatements of financial condition\u201d and audits prepared for Trump and several of his companies, including the one that owns the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington. The panel also requested supporting documents used to produce the reports and communications between the firm and Trump.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe accounting firm told us that they will respond and they just want a subpoena so we . . . we\u2019ve got to figure out how to accommodate them,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cBut apparently it would mean a friendly subpoena, I assume.\u201d\nThe Oversight Committee did not respond to a request for comment or clarification about whether the company planned to turn over all of what was requested.\nA company spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a March 27 letter responding to the committee, shared with The Washington Post, Mazars officials laid out rules and laws barring them from handing out client information without a \u201cvalidly issued and enforceable subpoena.\u201d\n\u201cAs I am sure you can appreciate, Mazars cannot voluntarily turn over the documents sought in the request,\u201d wrote Jerry D.

And as it happens, you can watch all the action right here.\nUnlike most recent phone events, this one is taking place in London. This means that time difference is a little friendlier for us Aussies. Things will kick off on October 17 at 12:00am AEDT, 11:30pm ACDT, 11PM AEST, 10:30pm ACST and 9pm AWST.\nThe rumour mill has been going into over-drive with this one and it kind of feels like we may already know what we\u2019re going to see when it comes to the Mate 20 Pro in particular. Various leaks have stated that in addition to the confirmed Kirin 980 chipset, it will have a 6.3-inch AMOLED panel, 6GB of RAM, 128GB storage option and run on Android Pie.\nThe First Huawei Mate 20 Pro Images Have Leaked Last month a render gave us our first look at what could be the new Huawei Mate 20. Now we may be looking at the Mate 20 Pro for the first time ahead of its October 16 launch in London. Read more\nThere have also been whispers of a 4,200mAh battery with wireless charging, which is a step up from the P20 series which only allowed wired.\nAlleged leaked images of the Mate 20 Pro also lack a rear or front fingerprint scanner, leading some to believe that it will have either an on-screen scanner (like the Porsche Design Mate RS does) or replicate Apple\u2019s by doubling down on facial recognition technology.\nFortunately, we don\u2019t have long to wait to find out if any of this is true, and to find out what the regular Mate 20 will have under the hood.

If the ABC had any ethical bone in their body, they would refuse to put this unfair and unbalanced story to air tonight,\u201d Hanson said, before directly addressing the new chairwoman of the ABC.\n\u201cIta Buttrose, you need to ask the question of your organisation as the chairwoman, is this the unethical behaviour you support or do you truly believe it should be aired before a full investigation by Asio and the federal police.\u201d\nIn a lengthy preprepared speech, Hanson blamed one of the journalists involved, Rodger Muller, who posed as a gun campaigner, for setting up all the meetings with the US National Rifle Association and multinational energy giant Koch Industries.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Rodger Muller and the Islamist al-Jazeera network, One Nation would never, never have had any association with the NRA, Koch industries or the congressional sportsmen\u2019s dinner. They would never have gone to the United States,\u201d she said.\n00:57 One Nation attempts to secure millions from NRA to soften Australia\u2019s gun laws \u2013 video\nBoth al-Jazeera and the ABC have stood by the report and its content as being in the public interest.\nHanson did not take any questions from journalists during the press conference, walking out immediately after reading her preprepared remarks.\nThe second part of the documentary also shows Hanson appearing to question the veracity of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania.\n\u201cAn MP said it would actually take a massacre in Tasmania to change the gun laws in Australia,\u201d Hanson was shown saying to Muller over dinner.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that? Have a look at it. It was said on the floor of parliament. I\u2019ve read a lot and I have read the book on it, Port Arthur. A lot of questions there.\u201d\n00:33 Pauline Hanson questions Port Arthur massacre in secret recording \u2013 video\nOn Thursday Hanson said her comments had been \u201cheavily edited\u201d and did not \u201creflect how I feel about those tragedies that occurred in 1996\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind, that Martin Bryant was the only person responsible for the murders of 35 innocent lives.

And you took it hook, line and sinker,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMedia across Australia have been blinded by hate and bias towards One Nation and myself, and rushed to report on heavily edited footage.\n\u201cYou have come here baying for my blood, and I will not give it to you. I answer to the Australian people only and they will have their say at the ballot box.\u201d\nMs Hanson said the comments captured on camera by Al Jazeera had been taken \u201ccompletely out of context\u201d.\nShe labelled Muller, an Australian journalist who conducted the three-year undercover investigation for Al Jazeera, a \u201cforeign agent\u201d.

How much money has the ABC paid, using taxpayer dollars, to organisations affiliated with the Qatari, Islamist government?\u201d\nMs Hanson singled out the new ABC chair Ita Buttrose, asking whether she truly believed the documentary should be aired before a \u201cfull investigation\u201d by the Australian Federal Police.\nOne Nation referred the matter to the AFP and ASIO earlier this week.\nThe ABC told news.com.au the documentary was \u201ccreated, commissioned and produced\u201d by Al Jazeera.\n\u201cAl Jazeera approached the ABC about the documentary and we acquired the broadcast rights according to our usual procedures,\u201d an ABC spokeswoman said.\n\u201cThe ABC assesses all content on its merits, ensuring it is consistent with ABC editorial policies, including recognised standards of accuracy, integrity, impartiality and fair and honest dealing.\n\u201cThe matters covered in the Al Jazeera program, including Australia\u2019s gun control laws, are of national public interest.\n\u201cThe ABC judged it was clearly in the public interest that Australians had the opportunity to see this material for themselves.\n\u201cThe reaction of the Australian public to these revelations has supported that decision.\u201d\nNews.com.au has also approached Al Jazeera for comment.\nOne Nation leader Pauline Hanson. Picture: Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images\nThere has been speculation about the futures of Mr Ashby and Mr Dickson, the central figures in the documentary, who fronted the media themselves on Tuesday afternoon.\nMs Hanson said she had \u201cno problem sacking people\u201d, but Mr Ashby would remain as her chief of staff and Mr Dickson would stay on One Nation\u2019s Senate ticket in Queensland.\n\u201cHe\u2019s made some stupid remarks, as we all have, but I worked so closely with this man for years to know his integrity is unquestionable,\u201d she said of Mr Ashby.\nShe said Mr Dickson had made some \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d, but he deserved a second chance.\n\u201cWhen I first saw the initial hit piece and Steve Dickson\u2019s comments, I was disgusted. But having watched my own comments, knowing how out of context they were portrayed to the Australian people, I knew he was stitched up,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI acknowledge Steve made some inappropriate comments, however, let\u2019s not forget he was set up. It was a ploy to destroy One Nation heading into the election.\n\u201cSteve has admitted and understands what he said wasn't the right thing, but he was taken out of context, and a victim of entrapment.\u201d\nShe said the pair were not in the United States to learn how to weaken Australia\u2019s gun laws, and her approval of their trip was to \u201clearn campaigning techniques, meet with other electoral officials and learn about the power and economy of the US\u201d.\nMs Hanson said she, Mr Ashby and Mr Dickson had all told Muller \u201cwe weren\u2019t changing the laws in Australia\u201d.\nShe said One Nation would \u201cnever\u201d accept foreign donations.\nMs Hanson also addressed the undercover footage which showed her appearing to suggest the 1996 Port Arthur Massacre was a government conspiracy.\nRELATED: Hanson casts doubt on Port Arthur Massacre\nShe said the comments were \u201cobviously heavily edited and do not reflect how I feel about those tragedies\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no question in my mind that Martin Bryant was the only person responsible,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy belief stands today that he should have faced the death penalty.\u201d\nFinally, Ms Hanson blasted Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement earlier today that the Liberals would preference One Nation below Labor at the election.\n\u201cYou have just handed the keys to The Lodge to Bill Shorten, Di Natale and the CFMEU. You\u2019re a fool,\u201d she said.\nPauline Hanson, flanked by James Ashby (left) and Steve Dickson. Picture: Bradley Kanaris/Getty Images\nSpeaking earlier, Mr Morrison said the footage of Ms Hanson speaking about Port Arthur, along with One Nation\u2019s reaction to the documentary, had convinced him to make that decision.\nThe Prime Minister had already ruled out a preference deal with One Nation last week, but repeatedly refused to offer a decisive opinion on whether the minor party should be preferenced last, or at least below Labor and the Greens.\nHe said it was a choice for the Liberal Party\u2019s state divisions to make when nominations for the election had closed.\nSpeaking this morning, Mr Morrison revealed he had brought forward that decision.\nRELATED: PM commits to preference One Nation behind Labor\nHe said he had been in touch directly with the party organisation and recommended that One Nation be preferenced below Labor.\n\u201cMy recommendation to them, which they are accepting, is that One Nation will be put below the Labor Party at the next election,\u201d he said.\nMr Morrison said it was a decision he had \u201cnot come to lightly\u201d, and he had based it on his \u201cstrong view about the sanctity of Australia\u2019s gun laws\u201d.\n\u201cI have left it for a few days to see what the response of the One Nation leadership would be and sadly, I\u2019m disappointed, and I find the response of those One Nation officials unsatisfactory,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere have been further revelations overnight also, which have led me to the position this morning.\n\u201cThe comments particularly last night and the linkages to Port Arthur, I was shocked by them.\n\u201cThese gun laws have kept Australia safe for 20 years and have led the world. They are one of the Liberal Party\u2019s proudest achievements.\u201d\nHis decision only applies to the Liberals \u2014 not the Nationals, who will reach their own conclusion on preferences.\nIt also doesn\u2019t apply to Nationals MPs from the LNP in Queensland.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t rushed into this decision, in the same way that John Howard, who I have been consulting with closely on this matter, did not rush into this decision when he took it 20 years ago.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate\nGREEN BAY, Wis. -- Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh received unprompted support from head coach Kyle Shanahan and cornerback Richard Sherman after the 49ers surrendered 521 yards and had multiple breakdowns in the secondary in a 33-30 loss to the Packers on Monday night.\n\"Saleh\u2019s very good at what he does,\" Shanahan said. \"I have a ton of confidence in him. I have a ton of confidence in our scheme.\"\nSaid Sherman: \"He\u2019s continued to call great games. And we\u2019ve got to find a way to reward him and finish.\"\nOn Green Bay\u2019s first offensive play, the 49ers had a busted coverage and wide receiver Marques Valdes-Scantling was all alone along the left sideline for a 60-yard catch-and run.\nSound familiar? The same thing happened a week earlier when Arizona\u2019s first play went for a 75-yard touchdown pass because of a blown assignment in the secondary.\nNow Playing: Stats from week 6 loss to Packers Video: San Francisco Chronicle\n\"On the first frickin\u2019 play, again, we bust it,\" Sherman said. \"We bust a simple coverage. It\u2019s a simple adjustment, and we bust. And you can\u2019t play like that. Later on in the game, another one. It\u2019s a simple play. And we bust.\"\nIndeed, the defense remained discombobulated. Three plays later after Valdes-Scantling\u2019s 60-yarder, the Packers bunched four wide receivers to left side, the 49ers covered them with two defenders and Aaron Rodgers\u2019 throw to Ty Montgomery, which was technically a lateral, resulted in a too-easy 2-yard scoring run.\nTwo drives later, Packers tight end Jimmy Graham slipped behind three defenders and ran free during a 54-yard catch-and-run. Two plays later, safety Adrian Colbert was trailing wide receiver Davante Adams several yards in coverage and surrendered a 19-yard touchdown.\n\"It\u2019s simple day-one football,\" Sherman said. \"Once again, that\u2019s why it\u2019s frustrating - it\u2019s simple day-one football that we\u2019ve got to figure out how to translate. I hear a lot of stuff out there blaming the coaches and Saleh. And the DB coach (Jeff Hafley).\n\"It doesn\u2019t really matter. At the end of the day, if you call the perfect call and they don\u2019t run the play the way you called it, what else can you do? You call the play, the guy has man (coverage), and you don\u2019t take the man. And it\u2019s going to lead to a big play. Aaron would find him if he was covered. To not cover him is frustrating.\"\nSherman, 30, is known for his football IQ and is well-versed in the Saleh\u2019s 4-3 defense, the same system Sherman played in with Seattle for his first seven seasons.\nHowever, there seems to be a disconnect with other players despite having familiarity with the defense. Sherman and rookie inside linebacker Fred Warner are the only defensive starters who weren\u2019t with the 49ers last year in Saleh\u2019s first season.\n\"This is one of the most sound schemes in football,\" Sherman said. \"That\u2019s why you see so many people executing it. When you don\u2019t play sound, it can lead to a bust. In any scheme, if you don\u2019t play sound, it can lead to big plays. We have to find a way to just play disciplined. When we stopped them, when we got three-and-outs, it wasn\u2019t anything special. It wasn\u2019t guys making stuff up. It was just guys doing their assignment. Nothing special.\"\n***************************\nCornerback Jimmie Ward exited with a hamstring injury in the fourth quarter and his injury proved to be significant.\nHe was replaced by Greg Mabin, who was in coverage on Rodgers\u2019 game-tying, 16-yard touchdown pass to Adams with 1:56 left. On Green Bay\u2019s game-winning drive, Mabin was in coverage on Rodgers back-to-back, 19-yard completions that set up Mason Crosby\u2019s 23-yard field goal as time expired.\nUnfortunately, Jimmie went down before that last drive, but (Mabin) came out and played hard,\" Sherman said. \"And that\u2019s all you can ask him to do.\"\nTwitter: @Eric_Branch", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "5118146124930447071", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/sports/dayton-colorado-what-know-about-tuesday-nit-game/XItH5b6YazA1tlQKy2NOkJ/", "ms_text": "W___: 1_ p.m., T______\nW____: C_ E_____ C_____, B______, C___.", "full_text": "\u00bb FOLLOW THE FLYERS: All the links you need for the season in one place\nProbable Dayton starters\nObi Toppin, 6-9, R-Fr., F, 14.2\nJosh Cunningham, 6-8, R-Sr., 13.6\nJalen Crutcher, 6-1, So., G, 13.1\nRyan Mikesell, 6-7, R-Jr., F, 10.0\nJordan Davis, 6-2, So., G, 9.7\nProbable Colorado starters\nTyler Bey, 6-7, So., G/F, 13.3\nMcKinley Wright, 6-0, So., G, 13.1\nShane Gatling, 6-2, Jr., G, 10.3\nD\u2019Shawn Schwartz, 6-7, So., G/F, 8.8\nEvan Battey, 6-8, Fr., F, 8.2\n\u00bb FOLLOW DAVID JABLONSKI: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook\nSeries history: Colorado leads 2-1.

Ilhan Omar, a Muslim woman who emerged as the Democratic nominee for a House seat currently held by another Muslim, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.).\n{mosads}Meanwhile, establishment candidates prevailed in Senate races in Wisconsin, where state Sen. Leah Vukmir, who won the endorsement of the state GOP earlier this year, emerged victorious over Marine Corps veteran Kevin Nicholson, a former Democrat who cast himself as a political outsider.\nLikewise, in Minnesota, Sen. Tina Smith (D) overcame a challenge from Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, in one of the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primaries.\nHere are the five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries:\nThe establishment flexes its muscle\nIt was a good night for the establishment, especially in Wisconsin\u2019s GOP primary for Senate.\nVukmir, who won the Wisconsin Republican Party\u2019s endorsement in May, edged out first-time candidate Nicholson in the state\u2019s GOP Senate primary, setting her up to challenge incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) in November.\nVukmir won the support of prominent Republicans and conservatives groups, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), former White House chief of staff and Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Priebus, and the National Rifle Association.\nNicholson sought to cast Vukmir, a longtime player in Wisconsin Republican politics and an ally of Gov. Scott Walker (R), as a political insider. But that line of attack failed to work with Wisconsin\u2019s GOP primary voters.\nThat\u2019s not to say that President Trump was absent from the race. Though he didn\u2019t endorse anybody, Vukmir often name-checked Trump\u2019s policy proposals on the campaign trail, expressing her support for his long-promised border wall and pledging to help \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.\nHer support for Trump was meant to inoculate herself from charges from Nicholson that she had been insufficiently loyal to the president.\nVukmir had made critical comments of Trump in the past and initially supported Walker during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, before backing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\nBut as a former Democrat, Nicholson was also vulnerable in a Republican primary, and he ultimately failed to make much of his Trump attacks against Vukmir.\nThe establishment also held strong in a couple of Minnesota primaries.\nSmith, who was appointed to the seat after Sen. Al Franken\u2019s resignation, cruised to victory over Painter. Smith, the former lieutenant governor, has deep ties to Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which endorsed her in the special election.\nAnd in the 1st District, Republican Jim Hagedorn, who\u2019s making his fourth run for Congress, won the GOP primary in the race to replace Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.). Hagedorn, the 2016 nominee who came close to unseating Walz, scored the state party\u2019s endorsement.\nOne glaring exception was in Minnesota\u2019s governor race, where former Gov. Tim Pawlenty failed to make a comeback bid. Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson won the Republican primary instead, after closely aligning himself with Trump.\nDemocrats make history\nDemocrats have been making history this cycle as more female, LGBT and minority candidates run for Congress \u2014 and win.\nIn Vermont, Democrats elected the first transgender gubernatorial nominee of a major political party after Christine Hallquist, a first-time candidate and the former CEO of the state\u2019s electricity co-op, emerged as the winner of the primary.\nShe now faces Republican Gov. Phil Scott in November, though it\u2019ll be an uphill climb for Democrats to take back the governor\u2019s mansion. Vermont may be a blue state, and one that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton easily won in 2016, but Scott remains popular, winning his first term by 8 points that same year.\nAnd in Minnesota\u2019s 5th District, Omar won in a crowded Democratic primary, and she\u2019ll likely be among the first Muslim women elected to Congress along with former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who won her Michigan Democratic primary earlier this month.\nOmar ran in the race to replace Ellison, who in 2006 was the first Muslim elected to Congress. A Somali-American, she was endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist who defeated a longtime incumbent in a New York House primary.\nAnd in the race to replace Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), Democrat Jahana Hayes, the 2016 Teacher of the Year, would be the first African-American Democrat elected to Congress from Connecticut \u2014 if she wins the general election in November.\n\u2018Ironstache\u2019 wins, but faces complicated path in race for Ryan\u2019s seat\nIronworker Randy Bryce may have secured the Democratic nomination to replace Ryan, the retiring House Speaker, in the southeast Wisconsin district, but it\u2019s not likely to be smooth sailing for the candidate dubbed \u201cIronstache\u201d as he heads into the general election.\nThe mustachioed 53-year-old garnered a reputation as a rising Democratic star after he announced his candidacy last summer in an emotional video about how his mother was struggling to afford vital drugs, which quickly went viral.\nBut Bryce faced a tougher-than-expected challenge from Janesville school board member Cathy Myers after being hit by a series of negative headlines regarding his past arrests for marijuana possession and driving under the influence, as well as the revelation that he failed to pay child support until after he declared his House bid.\nThose revelations are sure to fuel Republican attacks ahead of November, complicating his campaign fight against Republican Bryan Steil, who also secured his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday.\nSteil is a former aide to Ryan and received the endorsement of the outgoing Speaker. What\u2019s more, the Cook Political Report rates the district as \u201cleaning Republican,\u201d meaning Bryce and the Democrats are almost certain to face a tough path in flipping Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District.\nWill abuse allegations rock Ellison\u2019s bid for AG in November?\nEllison easily won the Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general, but it remains to be seen how his campaign will be affected going forward by recent domestic abuse allegations.\nEllison won 51 percent of the vote against four other Democrats in the open-seat race. Ellison had been considered the front-runner since he announced his candidacy in June.\nBut in recent days Ellison has faced abuse allegations after the son of his ex-girlfriend posted on Facebook that he watched a video where the congressman allegedly dragged his mother off a bed and shouted profanities at her.\nThe ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, backed up her son\u2019s account. But Ellison denies those allegations, saying that the video referenced doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt\u2019s still unclear how, or if, the allegations will roil Ellison\u2019s campaign going forward. But they\u2019re being taken seriously. The Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday that it is \u201creviewing\u201d the abuse allegations levied at Ellison, who serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman.\nEllison will face former state Rep. Doug Wardlow in November.\n\u2018Medicare for all\u2019 winning among Democrats\n\u201cMedicare for all\u201d may not be fading from the headlines any time soon after a number of Democrats won their respective primaries after campaigning heavily on that health-care message\nFew candidates did it as poignantly as Bryce, who made single-payer health care a critical part of his campaign messaging, including in his viral campaign announcement video featuring his mother. He was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has championed Medicare for all legislation in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, in Minnesota, Omar ran a progressive platform that includes a single-payer system among other progressive issues. And in Connecticut, Hayes also backs Medicare for all, as does Hallquist in Vermont.\nRepublicans have already indicated that they plan to weaponize Medicare for all, arguing that it\u2019ll spook more moderate voters in competitive seats. But Democrats who ran on this platform will ensure that it\u2019ll likely remain a campaign issue \u2014 provided they continue to talk about it frequently in a general election.", "sid": 1, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "3591038326856194780", "docid": 0, "url": "https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/401888-5-takeaways-from-primary-races-in-minnesota-wisconsin-connecticut-and", "ms_text": "A____________\nM________, e____________ c_________ p________ i_ S_____ r____ i_ W________, w____ s____ S__.

Leah Vukmir, who won the endorsement of the state GOP earlier this year, emerged victorious over Marine Corps veteran Kevin Nicholson, a former Democrat who cast himself as a political outsider.\nLikewise, in Minnesota, Sen. Tina Smith (D) overcame a challenge from Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, in one of the state\u2019s Democratic Senate primaries.\nHere are the five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries:\nThe establishment flexes its muscle\nIt was a good night for the establishment, especially in Wisconsin\u2019s GOP primary for Senate.\nVukmir, who won the Wisconsin Republican Party\u2019s endorsement in May, edged out first-time candidate Nicholson in the state\u2019s GOP Senate primary, setting her up to challenge incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) in November.\nVukmir won the support of prominent Republicans and conservatives groups, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), former White House chief of staff and Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Priebus, and the National Rifle Association.\nNicholson sought to cast Vukmir, a longtime player in Wisconsin Republican politics and an ally of Gov. Scott Walker (R), as a political insider. But that line of attack failed to work with Wisconsin\u2019s GOP primary voters.\nThat\u2019s not to say that President Trump was absent from the race. Though he didn\u2019t endorse anybody, Vukmir often name-checked Trump\u2019s policy proposals on the campaign trail, expressing her support for his long-promised border wall and pledging to help \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington.\nHer support for Trump was meant to inoculate herself from charges from Nicholson that she had been insufficiently loyal to the president.\nVukmir had made critical comments of Trump in the past and initially supported Walker during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, before backing Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\nBut as a former Democrat, Nicholson was also vulnerable in a Republican primary, and he ultimately failed to make much of his Trump attacks against Vukmir.\nThe establishment also held strong in a couple of Minnesota primaries.\nSmith, who was appointed to the seat after Sen. Al Franken\u2019s resignation, cruised to victory over Painter. Smith, the former lieutenant governor, has deep ties to Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which endorsed her in the special election.\nAnd in the 1st District, Republican Jim Hagedorn, who\u2019s making his fourth run for Congress, won the GOP primary in the race to replace Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.). Hagedorn, the 2016 nominee who came close to unseating Walz, scored the state party\u2019s endorsement.\nOne glaring exception was in Minnesota\u2019s governor race, where former Gov. Tim Pawlenty failed to make a comeback bid. Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson won the Republican primary instead, after closely aligning himself with Trump.\nDemocrats make history\nDemocrats have been making history this cycle as more female, LGBT and minority candidates run for Congress \u2014 and win.\nIn Vermont, Democrats elected the first transgender gubernatorial nominee of a major political party after Christine Hallquist, a first-time candidate and the former CEO of the state\u2019s electricity co-op, emerged as the winner of the primary.\nShe now faces Republican Gov. Phil Scott in November, though it\u2019ll be an uphill climb for Democrats to take back the governor\u2019s mansion. Vermont may be a blue state, and one that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton easily won in 2016, but Scott remains popular, winning his first term by 8 points that same year.\nAnd in Minnesota\u2019s 5th District, Omar won in a crowded Democratic primary, and she\u2019ll likely be among the first Muslim women elected to Congress along with former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who won her Michigan Democratic primary earlier this month.\nOmar ran in the race to replace Ellison, who in 2006 was the first Muslim elected to Congress. A Somali-American, she was endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist who defeated a longtime incumbent in a New York House primary.\nAnd in the race to replace Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), Democrat Jahana Hayes, the 2016 Teacher of the Year, would be the first African-American Democrat elected to Congress from Connecticut \u2014 if she wins the general election in November.\n\u2018Ironstache\u2019 wins, but faces complicated path in race for Ryan\u2019s seat\nIronworker Randy Bryce may have secured the Democratic nomination to replace Ryan, the retiring House Speaker, in the southeast Wisconsin district, but it\u2019s not likely to be smooth sailing for the candidate dubbed \u201cIronstache\u201d as he heads into the general election.\nThe mustachioed 53-year-old garnered a reputation as a rising Democratic star after he announced his candidacy last summer in an emotional video about how his mother was struggling to afford vital drugs, which quickly went viral.\nBut Bryce faced a tougher-than-expected challenge from Janesville school board member Cathy Myers after being hit by a series of negative headlines regarding his past arrests for marijuana possession and driving under the influence, as well as the revelation that he failed to pay child support until after he declared his House bid.\nThose revelations are sure to fuel Republican attacks ahead of November, complicating his campaign fight against Republican Bryan Steil, who also secured his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday.\nSteil is a former aide to Ryan and received the endorsement of the outgoing Speaker. What\u2019s more, the Cook Political Report rates the district as \u201cleaning Republican,\u201d meaning Bryce and the Democrats are almost certain to face a tough path in flipping Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District.\nWill abuse allegations rock Ellison\u2019s bid for AG in November?\nEllison easily won the Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general, but it remains to be seen how his campaign will be affected going forward by recent domestic abuse allegations.\nEllison won 51 percent of the vote against four other Democrats in the open-seat race. Ellison had been considered the front-runner since he announced his candidacy in June.\nBut in recent days Ellison has faced abuse allegations after the son of his ex-girlfriend posted on Facebook that he watched a video where the congressman allegedly dragged his mother off a bed and shouted profanities at her.\nThe ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, backed up her son\u2019s account. But Ellison denies those allegations, saying that the video referenced doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt\u2019s still unclear how, or if, the allegations will roil Ellison\u2019s campaign going forward. But they\u2019re being taken seriously. The Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday that it is \u201creviewing\u201d the abuse allegations levied at Ellison, who serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman.\nEllison will face former state Rep. Doug Wardlow in November.\n\u2018Medicare for all\u2019 winning among Democrats\n\u201cMedicare for all\u201d may not be fading from the headlines any time soon after a number of Democrats won their respective primaries after campaigning heavily on that health-care message\nFew candidates did it as poignantly as Bryce, who made single-payer health care a critical part of his campaign messaging, including in his viral campaign announcement video featuring his mother. He was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has championed Medicare for all legislation in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, in Minnesota, Omar ran a progressive platform that includes a single-payer system among other progressive issues. And in Connecticut, Hayes also backs Medicare for all, as does Hallquist in Vermont.\nRepublicans have already indicated that they plan to weaponize Medicare for all, arguing that it\u2019ll spook more moderate voters in competitive seats. But Democrats who ran on this platform will ensure that it\u2019ll likely remain a campaign issue \u2014 provided they continue to talk about it frequently in a general election.", "sid": 3, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "3591038326856194780", "docid": 0, "url": "https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/401888-5-takeaways-from-primary-races-in-minnesota-wisconsin-connecticut-and", "ms_text": "V_____, w__ w__ t__ W________ R_________ P____\u2019s e__________ i_ M__, e____ o__ f____-t___ c________ N________ i_ t__ s____\u2019s G__ S_____ p______, s______ h__ u_ t_ c________ i________ S__.

Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.), Democrat Jahana Hayes, the 2016 Teacher of the Year, would be the first African-American Democrat elected to Congress from Connecticut \u2014 if she wins the general election in November.\n\u2018Ironstache\u2019 wins, but faces complicated path in race for Ryan\u2019s seat\nIronworker Randy Bryce may have secured the Democratic nomination to replace Ryan, the retiring House Speaker, in the southeast Wisconsin district, but it\u2019s not likely to be smooth sailing for the candidate dubbed \u201cIronstache\u201d as he heads into the general election.\nThe mustachioed 53-year-old garnered a reputation as a rising Democratic star after he announced his candidacy last summer in an emotional video about how his mother was struggling to afford vital drugs, which quickly went viral.\nBut Bryce faced a tougher-than-expected challenge from Janesville school board member Cathy Myers after being hit by a series of negative headlines regarding his past arrests for marijuana possession and driving under the influence, as well as the revelation that he failed to pay child support until after he declared his House bid.\nThose revelations are sure to fuel Republican attacks ahead of November, complicating his campaign fight against Republican Bryan Steil, who also secured his party\u2019s nomination on Tuesday.\nSteil is a former aide to Ryan and received the endorsement of the outgoing Speaker. What\u2019s more, the Cook Political Report rates the district as \u201cleaning Republican,\u201d meaning Bryce and the Democrats are almost certain to face a tough path in flipping Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District.\nWill abuse allegations rock Ellison\u2019s bid for AG in November?\nEllison easily won the Democratic primary for Minnesota attorney general, but it remains to be seen how his campaign will be affected going forward by recent domestic abuse allegations.\nEllison won 51 percent of the vote against four other Democrats in the open-seat race. Ellison had been considered the front-runner since he announced his candidacy in June.\nBut in recent days Ellison has faced abuse allegations after the son of his ex-girlfriend posted on Facebook that he watched a video where the congressman allegedly dragged his mother off a bed and shouted profanities at her.\nThe ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, backed up her son\u2019s account. But Ellison denies those allegations, saying that the video referenced doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt\u2019s still unclear how, or if, the allegations will roil Ellison\u2019s campaign going forward. But they\u2019re being taken seriously. The Democratic National Committee said on Tuesday that it is \u201creviewing\u201d the abuse allegations levied at Ellison, who serves as the committee\u2019s vice chairman.\nEllison will face former state Rep. Doug Wardlow in November.\n\u2018Medicare for all\u2019 winning among Democrats\n\u201cMedicare for all\u201d may not be fading from the headlines any time soon after a number of Democrats won their respective primaries after campaigning heavily on that health-care message\nFew candidates did it as poignantly as Bryce, who made single-payer health care a critical part of his campaign messaging, including in his viral campaign announcement video featuring his mother. He was endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has championed Medicare for all legislation in the Senate.\nMeanwhile, in Minnesota, Omar ran a progressive platform that includes a single-payer system among other progressive issues. And in Connecticut, Hayes also backs Medicare for all, as does Hallquist in Vermont.\nRepublicans have already indicated that they plan to weaponize Medicare for all, arguing that it\u2019ll spook more moderate voters in competitive seats. But Democrats who ran on this platform will ensure that it\u2019ll likely remain a campaign issue \u2014 provided they continue to talk about it frequently in a general election.", "sid": 9, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "3591038326856194780", "docid": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/402026-election-countdown-gop-fears-weak-senate-gov-candidates-could-drag-down", "ms_text": "A____________\nW_'r_ 8_ d___ f___ t__ 2___ m______ e________ a__ 8__ d___ f___ t__ 2___ e________.", "full_text": "This is Election Countdown, The Hill\u2019s weekly newsletter from Lisa Hagen (@LA_Hagen) and Max Greenwood (@KMaxGreenwood) that brings you the biggest stories on the campaign trail.

A strong candidate at the head of a ticket can drive turnout in other contests on the ballot, and a weak candidate can hurt turnout in other races just as much.\nTuesday night was a bad night for a Republican squad hoping to defend its already-tenuous majority in the House, as voters opted for more conservative nominees in two battleground states over stronger and more traditional contenders expected to do well in the general election.\nIn Minnesota, those conservatives squelched former Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u2018s comeback bid, choosing Hennepin County Commissioner Jeff Johnson (R) as the Republican nominee for governor. And in Kansas, Gov. Jeff Colyer (R) conceded defeat to Kris Kobach, the lightening rod Kansas secretary of State who has President Trump\u2019s backing.\nAlready aware of the treacherous terrain they face this year, Reps. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) and Jason Lewis (R-Minn.) had urged Pawlenty to run for his old job, confident that a steady hand would mollify suburban voters who might otherwise want a change. Republicans had also hoped to pick up Democratic-held seats left vacant by Reps. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee for governor, and Rick Nolan.\n\u201cThey\u2019re both in more trouble with a weak gubernatorial nominee,\u201d one Minnesota Republican strategist said of Paulsen and Lewis. \u201cAnd we can forget about picking up\u201d the Walz or Nolan seats.\nIn Kansas, top aides to Rep. Kevin Yoder (R) voiced private concerns that having Kobach at the top of the ticket would energize Democrats and independents who can\u2019t stand the firebrand conservative. Republicans are also concerned that a seat being vacated by Rep. Lynn Jenkins (R) may be vulnerable.\n\u201cThis race will be nationalized,\u201d said one Kansas Republican familiar with the internal discussions. \u201cKobach is hated by independents. He energizes the [Democrats] to get out the vote.\u201d\nHow does a subpar top-of-the-ticket play out in down-ballot races? Look no farther than Virginia, where Sen. Tim Kaine (D) has spent this week campaigning with Abigail Spanberger, Elaine Luria and Jennifer Wexton, three Democratic candidates running for GOP-held House seats. Kaine has done more than 30 events with House candidates since the June primary, his campaign told The Hill.\nBy contrast, the Republican nominee facing Kaine, Prince William County Council chairman Corey Stewart, has based his pitch to voters on a pledge to defend Confederate statues \u2014 even though he is a Minnesota native. Not exactly the pitch that suburban voters in an increasingly blue state want to hear.\nA Virginia Commonwealth University poll released last week shows Kaine overwhelmingly leading Stewart. So don\u2019t expect to see Stewart campaigning alongside Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) any time soon.\nThe Hill\u2019s Reid Wilson has more here on Republican worries that weak top-of-the-ticket candidates could cost them the House.\nPrimary recap\nTwo big things from Tuesday\u2019s primaries: Democrats chose history-making nominees in three states and establishment candidates flexed their muscles in the Midwest.\nDemocratic voters in Vermont chose Christine Hallquist as their gubernatorial nominee, making her the first openly transgender woman to be nominated for a governorship by a major political party.\nIn Connecticut\u2019s 5th District, voters handed former National Teacher of the Year Jahana Hayes the Democratic nomination to replace Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D). If Hayes wins in November, she\u2019ll become the first black Democrat from Connecticut to serve in the House.\nAnd in Minnesota\u2019s 5th District, Ilhan Omar took the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Keith Ellison (D), likely setting her up to become one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\nTuesday was also a (largely) good night for establishment candidates, particularly in the two Midwestern primaries.\nLeah Vukmir, who carried the endorsement of the Wisconsin GOP, overcame a challenge from Kevin Nicholson in the state\u2019s GOP Senate primary, handing a defeat to a candidate who billed himself as a political outsider.\nAnd incumbent Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), a longtime player in Minnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, easily advanced to the state\u2019s special Senate election in November, beating out Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, in her primary.\nRead our takeaways from Tuesday night.\nRace for the White House\nMichael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against Trump, released his policy positions on Twitter as he weighs a 2020 bid. Among his positions, Avenatti supports \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which is gaining steam on the left flank of the party.\nAnd while we\u2019re on the subject of Avenatti, The Hill\u2019s Amie Parnes and Mike Lillis take a look at how Democrats are embracing Avenatti\u2019s call to be more aggressive in the Trump era\u2013making a notable switch from former first lady Michelle Obama\u2018s call to \u201cgo high.\u201d\nSenate showdown\nDemocrats and Republicans are vying for votes among Florida\u2019s burgeoning Puerto Rican population \u2013 a voting bloc that is expected to play a critical role in 2020 and beyond.\nOn the Republican side, party officials and outside groups are holding civics classes and resume-writing workshops to court Puerto Rican voters, The Hill\u2019s Rafael Bernal and Max Greenwood report. Meanwhile, Democrats are looking to field more diverse candidates as they seek to hold onto Puerto Ricans as reliable Democratic voters.\nMeanwhile, progressives are livid that Senate Democrats aren\u2019t doing enough to oppose Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, reports The Hill\u2019s Jordain Carney. Their frustrations come as vulnerable Senate Democrats o meet with Kavanaugh. They include Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.). He\u2019s already met with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).\nSurvey says\u2026\nSen. Bill Nelson (D) holds a slight lead over Gov. Rick Scott (R) in Florida\u2019s Senate race, a poll commissioned by the nonpartisan Hispanic Federation and several progressive Latino groups finds. The poll finds Nelson up, 44 to 41 percent, among Latinos statewide. Scott leads among Cuban-Americans, who lean conservative, while Nelson is ahead among Puerto Ricans.\nA new Monmouth University poll is showing the race for a competitive New Jersey House seat is a dead heat. Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) leads his Democratic challenger Andy Kim, a former national security aide in the Obama administration, 41 to 40 percent, an edge within the survey\u2019s margin of error. Trump won MacArthur\u2019s district in 2016, but Obama carried in both 2008 and 2012.\nNew polling is out from Navigator Research and here are some of the highlights: Democrats are leading the generic ballot by 8 points, 45 to 37 percent. The group found that opposition to the family separation policy has grown even as the administration has stopped the policy. Now 69 percent oppose it. And on the Supreme Court, 15 percent say they have a favorable view of Trump\u2019s nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while 28 percent view him unfavorably.\nPaper chase\nDemocratic mega-donor Tom Steyer announced Tuesday that he will spend $10 million on a get out the vote effort that he\u2019s calling \u201cNeed to Vote.\u201d The name is a play on his other initiative \u201cNeed to Impeach,\u201d which seeks to rally support for booting Trump from office. The Get-out-the-vote campaign will take out TV and digital ad spots, mail out handwritten letters encouraging supporters to vote and dispatch political operatives across the country.\nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) is going up on the airwaves\u2013and using the money he raised after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ran a negative ad against him. O\u2019Rourke, who has an uphill fight in his Senate bid in ruby-red Texas, is spending $1.27 million on a \u201cpositive\u201d ad campaign.\nWhat we\u2019re watching for\nHere\u2019s a list of the final primaries in August: Alaska and Wyoming hold primaries on Aug. 21 and Arizona and Florida have primaries on Aug. 28.\nRep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) is set to campaign alongside Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Aug. 18 in a trio of events the lawmakers are dubbing the \u201cFreedom Tour.\u201d Jordan is mounting a bid for House Speaker and DeSantis is Trump\u2019s choice for Florida governor. They\u2019ll be joined by another avid Trump supporter, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will debate progressive challenger, former \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Cynthia Nixon, on Aug. 29 in the state\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary.\nComing to a TV near you\nLess than 24 hours since the Wisconsin primary, Democrats and Republicans leapt out of the gate with new ads in the Senate and governor\u2019s races.\nIn the Senate primary, Democratic super PAC American Bridge is running an ad targeting newly minted GOP nominee Leah Vukmir. And Gov. Scott Walker (R) is also out with a new TV ad touting his agenda. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Republican Party launched an ad targeting Walker\u2019s Democratic opponent, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers.\nMeanwhile, the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) launched a flurry of new ads this week tarring Democratic candidates in competitive House races. The ads take Democrats to task over local issues as well as continuing to tie them to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). CLF is running ads in competitive GOP-held seats in California, New Jersey, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York and Maine.\nMike Braun, the Republican challenging Sen. Joe Donnelly (D) in Indiana, is out with a new digital ad campaign seeking to put pressure on Donnelly to support Kavanaugh\u2018s nomination. One ad questions whether Donnelly will get \u201cpermission\u201d from Democratic leaders to confirm him, while another demands that Chuck Schumer \u201callow Joe to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today.\u201d\nWave watch\nAbout a week after Washington state\u2019s primary, we finally know who Republican Dino Rossi will face in November. Democrat Kim Schrier, a physician won the second spot on the general election ballot in Washington\u2019s top-two primary. Rossi and Schrier will compete in the race to replace Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), whose seat Clinton carried by more than 3 points.\nPelosi is going back to a familiar strategy from 2006\u2013painting Republicans as corrupt in the wake of Rep. Chris Collins\u2019s (R-N.Y.) arrest on insider trading charges. Democrats are looking to hit home that strategy in the run-up to the midterms, linking the party to Collins and the scandals that have swept up White House officials. It\u2019s unclear how effective those attacks will be, but Democrats\u2013and Pelosi\u2013believe it can be a powerful campaign message like in 2006.\nAnd speaking of Collins, Democrats are threatening to sue to keep the New York congressman on the November ballot, which they believe will help them flip a deep-red Buffalo seat. Meanwhile, a dozen local Republicans are expressing interest in Collins\u2019s seat.\nAlso today\u2026 A new poll also shows Democrats up 11 points over Republicans on a generic House ballot. The Cook Political Report is moving four GOP races to the toss up category. And President Trump praised the results of Tuesday night\u2019s primaries, claiming that Republicans have \u201cthe team we want\u201d heading into the midterms.\nThe Hill\u2019s Election Countdown was written by Reid Wilson, Lisa Hagen, Max Greenwood, Jasper Goodman and Caroline Gardner.", "sid": 4, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "3591038326856194780", "docid": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/402026-election-countdown-gop-fears-weak-senate-gov-candidates-could-drag-down", "ms_text": "A__ i_ K_____, G__.

He also faces a Federal Election Commission complaint from his primary opponent, claiming he converted campaign funds to personal use.\nRepublicans were eager to pounce on his record.\n\u201cYou\u2019d need a Boeing 747 to fit all of the baggage Randy Bryce is carrying into November,\u201d said Chris Martin, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman.\nBryce\u2019s GOP opponent University of Wisconsin regent has $630,000. He is Ryan\u2019s former staffer and an attorney for a manufacturing company.\nDemocrats have long been vying for the chance to take out Wisconsin\u2019s GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who became a national political figure shortly after his first election in 2010 for his plan to eliminate nearly all of public workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights. He has been re-elected twice, including in a recall election forced by Democrats, and is running for a third term.\nState Schools Superintendent Tony Evers emerged the winner from a field eight Democratic primary candidates. While analysts say the race leans Republican in the fall, polls suggest Walker is vulnerable.\nFirsts\nTuesday's primaries positioned several candidates to make history.\nMinnesota State Rep. Ilhan Omar, the nation's first Somali-American legislator who once lived in a Kenyan refugee camp, is now likely to break that same barrier for Congress after winning the Democratic nod to compete for a safe blue House district in Minneapolis. If she wins, Omar and Democrat Rashida Tlaib, who will run unopposed in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District in November, will be the first Muslim women in Congress.\nIn Connecticut, political newcomer Jahana Hayes, who was the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, defeated former Simsbury First Selectman Mary Glassman in a two-way Democratic primary for a House seat. If she wins in November, Hayes will be Connecticut's first black Democrat along with the state's first black woman elected to Congress.\nAnd Vermont Democrats made history Tuesday night, nominating Christine Hallquist, the nation's first transgender gubernatorial candidate from a major political party. Hallquist, a former utility CEO, now faces Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, who is seeking his second term.\nWhere both parties could flip seats\nTuesday\u2019s primaries teed up four Minnesota House races that are considered toss-ups in November by the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Two are held by Democrats and two by Republicans.\nDemocratic Reps. Tim Walz and Rep. Rick Nolan left open two of Democrats\u2019 most vulnerable districts in the country \u2013 each voted for President Donald Trump \u2013 to run for statewide office.\nIn Walz\u2019s southern Minnesota district, Democrats nominated former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dan Feehan, while Republicans nominated 2014 and 2016 nominee Jim Hagedorn, who came within a point of beating Walz in 2016.\nThe Democratic-Farmer-Labor primary nod in Nolan\u2019s Iron Range district went to Nolan\u2019s 2016 campaign manager and former state Rep. Joe Radinovich. Republicans nominated St. Louis County Commissioner Pete Stauber.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are making a play for two Republican-held districts \u2013 those of GOP Reps. Erik Paulson, whose suburban Minneapolis district Clinton won, and Jason Lewis, who has come under fire recently for making anti-gay and misogynistic comments on radio shows in the past. CNN reported he once complained that it\u2019s no longer acceptable to call women \u201csluts.\u201d\nDemocrat Angie Craig, a former medical device executive and openly LGBTQ candidate, was uncontested in her bid to take on Lewis. And Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota liquor heir, will challenge Paulson. Both are on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s \u201cRed-to-Blue\u201d program, which gives top-tier candidates organizational and fundraising support.\nSurviving Trump bashing\nWisconsin Republicans were willing to look beyond a recently emerging 2016 video of state GOP Sen. Leah Vukmir bashing President Donald Trump as \u201coffensive to everyone,\u201d even after attack ads portraying her as anti-Trump.\nVukmir beat Marine Corps veteran and first-time candidate Kevin Nicholson for the chance to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is favored to win in the fall.\nGOP voters in Wisconsin overwhelmingly support Trump now, but most didn\u2019t have a favorable view of him back in 2016, voting instead for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the primary.\nVukmir was the establishment favorite endorsed by the state party, while Nicholson portrayed himself as a conservative outsider. He was endorsed by conservative organizations, including Club for Growth, though he was once a rising star in the Democratic Party.\nThe video of Vukmir at an event hosted by \u201cNever Trumper\u201d Charlie Sykes emerged in an article on Breitbart.com, the conservative website once run by Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon. Vukmir was forced to defend herself against ads from outside groups and a digital ad from Nicholson saying Vukmir was \u201cwrong on Trump.\u201d\nMinnesota GOP voters also heard about Trump bashing in the GOP gubernatorial primary between former Gov. Tim Pawlenty, against party\u2019s 2014 nominee, Jeff Johnson, now a county commissioner. But in that case, both candidates took heat for comments in 2016. Pawlenty called him \"unhinged and unfit,\" and Johnson called him a \"jackass.\" Johnson won the GOP nod in that race.\nVermont bucks trends\nVermont broke barriers by nominating Hallquist in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.\nBut in a historic year for women candidates, Tuesday\u2019s primaries also ensured the Green Mountain State won\u2019t soon shed its status as the only state that hasn\u2019t sent a woman to the Senate or House.\nSen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch won their primaries and neither faces tough opposition in November.\nVermont became the last remaining state with this distinction this year, when Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., was appointed to fill a vacancy in April.\nIt may seem surprising, given that the state ranks first among state legislatures for its proportion of women, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The state has elected a female governor \u2013 Madeleine Kunin, a Democrat \u2013 and women lieutenant governors among other statewide elective executives. And Kunin is the only woman elected to serve three terms as governor.\nVermont has only one at-large member of Congress. Other states with small delegations have sent women to Congress, but Vermont is not alone in taking its time. Only last year, Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester took her oath of office as Delaware\u2019s lone congresswoman, becoming the state\u2019s first African-American and woman to serve in Congress.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "220344112439231644", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/327339-general-elections-2018-pti-unveils-list-of-electoral-candidates", "ms_text": "E_______ 2___: P__ u______ l___ o_ e________ c_________\nL_____: P_______ T______-e-I____ (P__) o_ F_____ u_______ t__ f____ l___ o_ i__ c_________ c_________ i_ t__ u_______ g______ e________.", "full_text": "LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Friday unveiled the final list of its candidates contesting in the upcoming general elections.\nThe list was displayed on PTI's official website, according to which the party has fielded 173 candidates for the National Assembly and 290 for the provincial assembly seats.\nAmid a tough situation over the distribution of tickets, the final list of electoral candidates decided by the parliamentary board of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, quashing the rumors as who would get party tickets for the electoral tussle scheduled on July 25th,\nPTI chief, Imran Khan would contest the elections from five constituencies, including NA-35 Bannu, NA-53 Islamabad II, NA-95 Mianwali I, NA-131 Lahore IX and NA-243 Karachi.\nOther prominent party leaders to contest the elections for the lower house of parliament seats included, PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Pervaiz Khattak, Asad umar, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, Samsam Bukhari, Zulfikar Khosa and Yasmin Rashid.\nPTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi would foray into the next electoral battle from NA-156 Multan.\nPervez Khattak and Murad Saeed will be PTI\u2019s candidates for NA-25 Nowshera and NA-4 Swat, respectively.\nWhile Veteran politician Ghulam Mustafa Khar would be PTI's candidate from NA-181 Muzaffargarh.

The process uses special DNA testing on the Y chromosome, Brown said in a letter that ABC News reported at the time, referring to the chromosome found in males only.\nMourners carry the casket of Karina Vetrano from St. Helen's Church following her funeral in the Howard Beach section of the Queens, New York, Aug. 6, 2016.

John Russo, one of the lead detectives in Karina Vetrano's case, remembered calling the police on a man wandering near his own Howard Beach home on May 30 and May 31, 2016. Russo testified that he tracked down the police officers who answered his 911 call to see if they retained their notes from the May 2016 stop-and-frisk. The responding officer's notes read that Chanel Lewis was the unknown person in Russo\u2019s neighborhood and asked for a DNA swab from Lewis.\nFeb. 2, 2017: Lewis, then 20, volunteered to give a sample of his DNA.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Outrage mounted among parents and students who said the scheme showed those who play by the rules are losing precious seats at elite universities to unscrupulous families with money and clout.\nIn response, Georgetown disclosed that it tightened vetting of athletic credentials after the university in late 2017 discovered \u201cirregularities\u201d in the recruiting practices of tennis coach Gordon Ernst. The coach, who left the university last year, was among dozens of people charged with crimes in the college admissions cheating and bribery conspiracy revealed Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Boston.\nAdvertisement\nOlivia Jade\u2019s college acceptance is under scrutiny after her mother was accused of participating in a college admissions scandal. (Video: Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post)\nAuthorities said conspirators manufactured test scores and funneled payments to coaches who designated favored applicants as recruits, giving them priority in admissions. Affected schools said they were reviewing records of current students and graduates who may be connected to the scheme \u2014 even though law enforcement officials have not charged any students with crimes. The University of Southern California, one of the schools at the epicenter of the scandal, said it would make \u201cinformed, appropriate decisions\u201d once its reviews are done.\nThe scandal exposed glaring weaknesses in a system built on trust, added to festering \u2014 and long-standing \u2014 doubts about fairness in admissions and renewed debate over the enduring power of wealth to influence who gets into the most prestigious universities. At many prominent schools, the rich far outnumber the poor.\nLiana Keesing, 18, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Va., said she and college-bound classmates were irate. Keesing plans to attend Stanford in the fall and join the fencing team. She said the corruption detailed in court documents, including doctored photographs of purported student-athletes sent in admission portfolios, was an insult to the hard work of honest students everywhere, including real student-athletes like herself.\nAdvertisement\nAuthorities charged more than 50 people, like actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, March 12 with being part of a long-running college admittance scam. (Video: Allie Caren, Justin Scuiletti/The Washington Post)\n\u201cThis is a level of egregiousness that is absurd,\u201d Keesing said. \u201cIt is disappointing to find out that it happens to such a crazy extent.\u201d\nCollege admissions has come under scrutiny in the past year, especially through a federal lawsuit accusing Harvard of bias against Asian Americans. That suit, which went to trial in the fall, marks the latest chapter in a decades-old debate over affirmative action. The Harvard case illuminated a wealth of data about not only the role of race in admission decisions but also the extra edge given to recruited athletes and children of alumni.\nOn Wednesday, students of color said they felt vindicated. Often, students said, they are forced to deal with classmates\u2019 suspicions that their skin color, not their academic achievements, got them into college. But the scandal offered a strong suggestion that the ones who had unjustly earned slots were wealthy, mostly white and academically unqualified.\nAdvertisement\nA tweet made the rounds in the community of first-generation and low-income students at Princeton University: \u201cwow, it turns out money was the real Affirmative Action all along!\u201d\nThe Trump administration joined in the condemnation. \u201cEvery student deserves to be considered on their individual merits when applying to college and it\u2019s disgraceful to see anyone breaking the law to give their children an advantage over others,\u201d Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said. \u201cThe department is looking closely at this issue and working to determine if any of our regulations have been violated.\u201d\nAlso on Wednesday, \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin \u2014 one of the parents charged with paying bribes to help get children into college \u2014 appeared in court in Los Angeles. A judge ruled she could be released after posting $1 million bond. In Austin, the University of Texas said it fired tennis coach Michael Center, who was charged in the case.\nAdvertisement\nDouglas L. Wilson Sr., 49, a government worker and father of 10 who lives in Southeast Washington, said he and his wife never went to college. Seven of their children are in college or received degrees. The youngest three have not yet graduated from high school. He said his children have studied hard, earned scholarships, borrowed money to pay tuition \u2014 and never taken shortcuts. Bribing a coach or paying for a fake SAT or ACT score would have been inconceivable to him, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I\u2019m not shocked,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone is shocked. This is the way the world works.\u201d\nAcross the admissions world, there was consensus that the scandal posed a huge challenge because it shattered confidence of students and families.\n\u201cTrust is critically important,\u201d said Jenny Rickard, president and chief executive of the Common Application, an online admissions portal for more than 800 colleges that draws more than 1 million applicants a year. \u201cSchools want to be trusting of the students, the counseling communities, the teachers and others who help students apply. And the students and others need to be able to trust the institution that they\u2019re going to be considered fairly and equitably.\u201d\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, of Newport Beach, Calif., the mastermind of the cheating and bribery scheme who has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges, was able to identify and exploit what he called a \u201cside door\u201d into colleges that reject far more applicants than they admit. That door was guarded by allegedly corruptible coaches who wield heavy influence over admission slots. Among those charged in the case: a former women\u2019s volleyball coach at Wake Forest University, a former women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale, a former men\u2019s soccer coach at the University of California at Los Angeles and a former water polo coach at USC. Many parents were also charged.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cTo some extent, the system got hacked,\u201d said Jim Jump, a former president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling who writes on the ethics of college admissions for Inside Higher Education. \u201cThe people involved found a vulnerability. That vulnerability is the way athletic admissions is done.\u201d\nEssentially, admissions officers take coaches at their word when a recruit is recommended. Georgetown shifted course in November. The university now requires head coaches to provide a written description of a recruited athlete \u2014 something like an athletic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or other documentation of accomplishments \u2014 before the admission office releases a letter telling students they\u2019re admitted or likely to be.\nGeorgetown also said it plans to audit sports programs regularly to determine which athletic recruits don\u2019t participate on teams after enrolling. Stanford said it fired a sailing coach, John Vandemoer, who accepted financial contributions to recommend two candidates. One of the two was denied admission, Stanford said, and the other never completed an application.\nAdvertisement\nAnother long-noted vulnerability is the security of admissions testing. The scandal showed some parents were willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to help their children cheat on the ACT or SAT.

Then a stand-in or proctor at a site Singer \u201ccontrolled\u201d through bribes would manipulate the test to get the right result.\nAuthorities named Mark Riddell, a college-entrance exam counselor, as Singer\u2019s cheating accomplice and charged him in the case. Riddell on Wednesday apologized through a lawyer and said he was taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for his actions.\nThe College Board, which owns the SAT, said charges against Singer and others sent \u201ca clear message that those who facilitate cheating on the SAT \u2014 regardless of their income or status \u2014 will be held accountable.\u201d The ACT also commended law enforcement.\nAdvertisement\nBut affluent families routinely secure an edge in testing without breaking the law.

Mr. Systrom, 34, and Mr. Krieger, 32, have known each other since 2010, when they met and transformed a software project built by Mr. Systrom into what eventually became Instagram, which now has more than one billion users.\nIn a statement late Monday, Mr. Systrom said he and Mr. Krieger were \"ready for our next chapter,\" and hinted that they would create something new.\n\"We're planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again,\" Mr. Systrom said. \"Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that's what we plan to do.\"\nMore from the New York Times:\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, praised the Instagram founders in a statement and said that he wished them \"all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing what they build next.\"\nThe departures raise questions about Instagram's future at a time when Facebook faces its most sustained set of crises in its 14-year history. For much of the past two years, critics have railed against Facebook for being careless with user data and for not preventing foreign interference across its network of more than two billion people. The issues have started taking a toll on Facebook's business, with the company saying in July that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had slowed down.\nAgainst those problems, Instagram has been one of the jewels of Facebook. The social network acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, when the photo-sharing site was used by around 30 million people. Since then, Instagram's reach has ballooned and it has widely been seen as one of Facebook's most successful acquisitions.\nFacebook has lost other founders of businesses it has acquired. In April, Jan Koum, a Facebook board member and a founder of WhatsApp, the messaging app that the social network purchased in 2014, said he was leaving. Mr. Koum had grown increasingly concerned about Facebook's position on user data in recent years, people with knowledge of the situation said at the time.\nIn Silicon Valley, reaction to the Instagram founders' resignation was swift.\n\"Wow,\" tweeted John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock, calling the exits \"a real moment.\" He added, \"What an impact they've had on all of us.\"\nInstagram was founded in 2010 and at first was a location check-in app called Burbn. Mr. Krieger, an enthusiastic user of Burbn, met Mr. Systrom at a Stanford University fellowship program and they decided to work together. Eventually, Burbn was retooled and renamed Instagram.\nInstagram became popular in Silicon Valley almost immediately. The app heavily emphasized the use of a smartphone camera as iPhones were being widely adopted, turning everyday people into amateur photographers. Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger popularized photo filters and camera lenses, spurring a wave of copycat apps for the iPhone and Android-based smartphones.\nThe duo worked out of a small office in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco. Instagram spent a lot of money in its early years just trying to keep its app online as its servers struggled under the constant stream of new user sign-ups.\nInstagram eventually caught the eye of Mr. Zuckerberg, who realized how powerful Instagram's nascent photo-sharing network would become, and saw the wealth of photo-sharing activity across his own social network. Mr. Zuckerberg handled the negotiations with Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger largely on his own.\nFacebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock (though the final cost was closer to $715 million because the stock on which part of the deal was based declined in value). It was Facebook's biggest acquisition to date, and came a month before the social network's initial public offering.\n\"For years, we've focused on building the best experience for sharing photos with your friends and family,\" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post about the deal. \"Now, we'll be able to work even more closely with the Instagram team to also offer the best experiences for sharing beautiful mobile photos with people based on your interests.\"\nThe deal immediately turned Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger into millionaires many times over. Instagram has since been valued at 100 times that $1 billion acquisition price by Bloomberg Intelligence, a sizable return on investment on paper.\nFacebook went on to purchase Parse, a service that provided tools for mobile developers, and Oculus, a virtual reality hardware start-up, branching into new areas beyond the original social network. Mr. Zuckerberg also spent $19 billion to buy WhatsApp.\nBut Instagram remained Mr. Zuckerberg's main success story. As Facebook saw a threat in young people departing the network for Snapchat, a rival photo-sharing network, Instagram was quick to shift and recreate one of Snapchat's key features of online stories. Since then, Instagram has surged further in popularity, while Snapchat's growth has been inconsistent.\nThe departures of Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger create uncertainty around the app. It is unclear who will lead the company on the founders' departures, and if that person can continue Instagram's longstanding success streak. Marne Levine, who was previously Instagram's chief operating officer, left her role at Instagram earlier this month to return to Facebook and lead partnerships.\nWATCH: The man who \"invented\" the #hashtag and how it changed social media", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "5307299934987630854", "docid": 0, "url": "https://fox13now.com/2018/10/23/emotionally-damaged-university-of-utah-students-cope-with-recent-shooting-death/", "ms_text": "P_____ e_____ J_________ t_ w____ t___ v____\nS___ L___ C___ -- S_______ a__ d______ w___ a s_______ M_____ n____ o_ t__ U_________ o_ U___ c_____ t___ l___ o__ d___.", "full_text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Students are dealing with a shooting Monday night on the University of Utah campus that left one dead.\n\"I was up at my little cluster common area with my friends watching a movie and all of a sudden one of our friends got a text on their phone saying that there\u2019s a school shooting,\" Clayton Allard, a freshman at the University of Utah said.\nAll classes were cancelled Tuesday out of respect for all who knew senior and track athlete Lauren McCluskey, who was shot and killed by a former boyfriend.\n\"It makes me think he must\u2019ve been a really good liar to her, especially if he was 37-years-old and she was a college student,\" freshman Sophia Marchiafava said. \"It just kind of makes you think about stuff, that people aren\u2019t always who they say they are, and you have to be careful about who you trust.\"\n\"I believe the feeling of sadness and just outrage is mutual with everyone whose involved and those that are not involved directly,\" senior Felipe Noriega said.\nCampus counselors remind students there is always someone to talk to.\n\"We will provide support on campus today by sending counselors to three of our residence halls,\" Lauren Weitzman, director of the University Counseling Center said. \"We're also staffing our in house Mindfulness Center for students who just want to come over to the Counseling Center and receive immediate support.\"\nStudents mentioned gun control laws and additional campus security cameras, but they say, sometimes incidents like this can't be avoided.\n\"Obviously nothing will bring the student back,\" Noriega said, \"But the least they can do is to be a good support for the family and friends, and they're doing that.\"\nCounselors say their office will be open Wednesday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.\nSchool officials expect school to be back in session as normal.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "5307299934987630854", "docid": 1, "url": "https://fox13now.com/2018/10/22/shooting-reported-on-university-of-utah-campus-secure-in-place-order-issued/", "ms_text": "P_____ e_____ J_________ t_ w____ t___ v____\nS___ L___ C___-- A f_____ U_________ o_ U___ s______ w__ s___ a__ k_____ o_ c_____ M_____ e______, a__ t__ s________ g_____ w__ l____ f____ d___ i_____ a S___ L___ C___ c_____ w___ a s___-i________ g______ w____.", "full_text": "SALT LAKE CITY-- A female University of Utah student was shot and killed on campus Monday evening, and the suspected gunman was later found dead inside a Salt Lake City church with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nLauren McCluskey of Pullman, Washington was found dead in a parking lot outside of the south tower of the Medical Plaza, a residential hall on campus, after police responded to a report of a possible abduction around 8:20 p.m. Monday.\nStudents, educators and other staff were ordered to shelter in place on campus as police searched for the shooter, but that order was lifted just before midnight.\nSalt Lake City Police encountered the suspected gunman, 37-year-old Melvin Rowland, in downtown Salt Lake City early Tuesday morning.

They stated she ended the relationship earlier this month after finding out the truth.\nThe family states McCluskey sought the help of police to get her car back from Rowland on October 10, the day after she ended their relationship, and subsequently reported his continued harassment to police.

We may find out on at least one count.\nBarella, 26, came up through the ranks at Cagliari before moving to Inter in 2020. He\u2019s an elite playmaker and ball progressor who seeks to find spaces up the pitch to receive it, too.\nHe has six goals and seven assists in 30 appearances across all competitions this season, and he\u2019s up to 42 caps with Italy.\nGravenberch, 20, moved from Ajax in the summer and has made 22 appearances totaling 665 minutes as of post time, scoring a goal and an assist in cup play against Viktoria Koln.\nBefore making the move, Gravenberch was one of the most sought-after young players on the market. He\u2019s not on the same level as Barella in ball movement but he\u2019s very good at creating shots and is a harder tackler and defensive presence than Barella.\nLiverpool is also named alongside Newcastle, Spurs, and West Ham as a club \u201cmonitoring\u201d Mainz\u2019s Anton Stach, via 90min.com.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar. (NM)\nJanuary 17 \u2013 Ruben Neves continues to be linked with Liverpool\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a transfer window if Ruben Neves wasn\u2019t linked with a move away from Wolves, would it? The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell. (JPW)\nJanuary 16 \u2013 Jurgen Klopp perturbed with transfer questions\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is the mouthpiece for the club, and the mouthpiece for the club would like to stop answering questions about transfers.\n\u201cIt must be a language issue,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt must be, that you ask these questions again and again and again,\u201d he told reporters, via The Liverpool Echo. \u201cI answered it already so often. We look outside as well. It\u2019s not that we are stubborn and think, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019ll go with these boys until 2050.\u2019 That\u2019s not how we see it.\u201d\nKlopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers.\n\u201cWe are underperforming, definitely. I know that but I cannot sit here and blame everyone else. The players, it is my responsibility that they perform. It\u2019s my first concern, my first job to do. \u2026 Yes, we have to strengthen. Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much. I can\u2019t change the answer every week because the situation doesn\u2019t change, even when we lose another game since the last press conference.\u201d\nLiverpool has brought in Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo, and Fabio Carvalho on permanent deals while also loaning in Arthur Melo. Last season, they bought Luis Diaz and Ibrahima Konate.\nThe Reds looked as mixed up as a hound\u2019s breakfast in their weekend loss to Brighton, a setback that Klopp implied was the worst performance of his managerial career. (NM)\nJanuary 16 \u2013 Liverpool linked with discount Ruben Neves deal\nThere are reports that Ruben Neves\u2019 contract situation at Wolves could give Liverpool its latest Anfield discount.\nSomehow, the Reds have been able to land players below market price rather often but this one is an easier explanation: Neves only has 18 months left on his deal and Wolves may want to cash in now.\nNeves is a sensational midfielder but Wolves would potentially be risking their Premier League status, though perhaps they feel Julen Lopetegui\u2019s system can thrive without Neves.\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer for the Reds, even in Klopp\u2019s money-complaint world (see update above this one). (NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game. Might this be the difference for the Reds as they charge onward in both the Premier League\u2019s top four race and the UEFA Champions League? More at LiverpoolFC.com. (NM) What did @VirgilvDijk tell Cody Gakpo about the club before the move? \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) December 28, 2022\nDecember 26 \u2013 Liverpool in \u2018advanced talks\u2019 with Cody Gakpo\nWell, well, well. Just when it looked like Manchester United were going to sign Cody Gakpo, it appears their bitter rivals Liverpool are set to swoop in and sign the Dutch winger.\nHis current club, PSV Eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and Gakpo is heading to Liverpool for a medical.\nPSV and @LFC have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of Cody Gakpo. The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham. (JPW)\nJuly 7 \u2013 Joe Gomez signs long-term contract extension\nJoe Gomez might not be a first- (or second-) choice center back for Liverpool anymore, with Ibrahima Konate and Joel Matip both out-appearing him last season, but the 25-year-old is keen to continue his seven-year stay an Anfield. Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. I think as a group, the sky is the limit. We want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all.\u201d\nJuly 1 \u2013 Mohamed Salah signs new Liverpool deal\nSo, updating the note below\u2026\nIt\u2019s a three-year deal for Salah, who will join holdovers Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino in addition to new signing Darwin Nunez in chasing down Manchester City.\nRead more here\nThe incredible journey continues \ud83d\ude0d#SalahStays \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) July 1, 2022\nJune 25 \u2013 Liverpool open to selling Salah this summer\nLiverpool are reportedly open to selling Mohamed Salah this summer as the Egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years. (JPW)\nJune 22 \u2013 Sadio Mane unveiled by Bayern Munich\nBayern Munich is claiming Sadio Mane as a coup for its club and league after the Bundesliga champions unveiled the 30-year-old on Wednesday.\nHere\u2019s Bayern board member Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107:\n\u201cIn Sadio Mane a top international star is coming to FC Bayern, who has left his mark on world football. We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. The fact that he\u2019s joining FC Bayern shows that our club and he have big aims. Sadio Man\u00e9 fits perfectly with the football that FC Bayern play under Julian Nagelsmann.\u201d (NM)\nJune 22 \u2013 Liverpool, Monaco agree transfer fee for Takumi Minamino\nTakumi Minamino\u2019s time at Anfield appears to be over after Liverpool and Monaco reportedly agreed a transfer fee for the 27-year-old Japan international. The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already. He will have his work cut-out to replace TAA at right back but perhaps his arrival will allow the Alexander-Arnold to move further forward or even play in central midfield?

This asks more questions of Mohamed Salah, who is entering the final year of his deal at Anfield (NM).\nJune 14 \u2013 Darwin Nunez unveiled by Liverpool\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is excited by the potential of his latest massive purchase, especially because possible nine-figure striker Darwin Nunez is already very, very good.\n\u201cDarwin is a wonderful player; already really good but so much potential to get even better,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting, to be honest. His age, his desire, his hunger to be even better than he currently is. His belief in our project and what we are looking to do as a club.\u201d\nRead more about the League Cup and FA Cup winners\u2019 latest big cash splash, here (NM).\nJune 12 \u2013 Liverpool set to sign Darwin Nunez for club-record $105 million\nDarwin Nunez to Liverpool looks to be close to completion, as the Uruguayan ace is reportedly on his way to Anfield.\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, the 22-year-old Benfica star has agreed a six-year contact at Liverpool and the Premier League giants have also agreed a transfer fee with his current club. Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit. (JPW)\nJune 8 \u2013 Reds ready to break their transfer record for Darwin Nunez\nJurgen Klopp could bring Uruguayan center forward Darwin Nunez to Anfield as the Reds continue to spend as much as much as the next guy. The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee. Reports out of Portugal say that Liverpool has met that $106 million fee.

It\u2019ll be $85 million upfront, with the remaining $22 million available through add-ons. (AE)\nJune 7 \u2013 Liverpool reject opening bid from Bayern Munich for Sadio Mane\nBayern Munich reportedly offered $26 million (plus $5 million in add-ons) for Sadio Mane, but the Bundesliga giants were quickly turned away by Liverpool. Bayern will no doubt be back with another offer, though they hope to cap their costs at around $50 million. (AE)\nMay 31 \u2013 Darwin Nunez on Liverpool\u2019s radar\nAccording to a report from FootballTransfers, Uruguayan forward Darwin Nunez, 22, is a target for the Reds this summer. After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

We may find out on at least one count.\nBarella, 26, came up through the ranks at Cagliari before moving to Inter in 2020. He\u2019s an elite playmaker and ball progressor who seeks to find spaces up the pitch to receive it, too.\nHe has six goals and seven assists in 30 appearances across all competitions this season, and he\u2019s up to 42 caps with Italy.\nGravenberch, 20, moved from Ajax in the summer and has made 22 appearances totaling 665 minutes as of post time, scoring a goal and an assist in cup play against Viktoria Koln.\nBefore making the move, Gravenberch was one of the most sought-after young players on the market. He\u2019s not on the same level as Barella in ball movement but he\u2019s very good at creating shots and is a harder tackler and defensive presence than Barella.\nLiverpool is also named alongside Newcastle, Spurs, and West Ham as a club \u201cmonitoring\u201d Mainz\u2019s Anton Stach, via 90min.com.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar. (NM)\nJanuary 17 \u2013 Ruben Neves continues to be linked with Liverpool\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a transfer window if Ruben Neves wasn\u2019t linked with a move away from Wolves, would it? The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell. (JPW)\nJanuary 16 \u2013 Jurgen Klopp perturbed with transfer questions\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is the mouthpiece for the club, and the mouthpiece for the club would like to stop answering questions about transfers.\n\u201cIt must be a language issue,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cIt must be, that you ask these questions again and again and again,\u201d he told reporters, via The Liverpool Echo. \u201cI answered it already so often. We look outside as well. It\u2019s not that we are stubborn and think, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019ll go with these boys until 2050.\u2019 That\u2019s not how we see it.\u201d\nKlopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers.\n\u201cWe are underperforming, definitely. I know that but I cannot sit here and blame everyone else. The players, it is my responsibility that they perform. It\u2019s my first concern, my first job to do. \u2026 Yes, we have to strengthen. Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much.

(NM)\nJanuary 16 \u2013 Liverpool linked with discount Ruben Neves deal\nThere are reports that Ruben Neves\u2019 contract situation at Wolves could give Liverpool its latest Anfield discount.\nSomehow, the Reds have been able to land players below market price rather often but this one is an easier explanation: Neves only has 18 months left on his deal and Wolves may want to cash in now.\nNeves is a sensational midfielder but Wolves would potentially be risking their Premier League status, though perhaps they feel Julen Lopetegui\u2019s system can thrive without Neves.\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer for the Reds, even in Klopp\u2019s money-complaint world (see update above this one). (NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game. Might this be the difference for the Reds as they charge onward in both the Premier League\u2019s top four race and the UEFA Champions League? More at LiverpoolFC.com. (NM) What did @VirgilvDijk tell Cody Gakpo about the club before the move? \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) December 28, 2022\nDecember 26 \u2013 Liverpool in \u2018advanced talks\u2019 with Cody Gakpo\nWell, well, well. Just when it looked like Manchester United were going to sign Cody Gakpo, it appears their bitter rivals Liverpool are set to swoop in and sign the Dutch winger.\nHis current club, PSV Eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and Gakpo is heading to Liverpool for a medical.\nPSV and @LFC have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of Cody Gakpo. The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. I think as a group, the sky is the limit.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. The fact that he\u2019s joining FC Bayern shows that our club and he have big aims.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

(NM) What did @VirgilvDijk tell Cody Gakpo about the club before the move? \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) December 28, 2022\nDecember 26 \u2013 Liverpool in \u2018advanced talks\u2019 with Cody Gakpo\nWell, well, well. Just when it looked like Manchester United were going to sign Cody Gakpo, it appears their bitter rivals Liverpool are set to swoop in and sign the Dutch winger.\nHis current club, PSV Eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and Gakpo is heading to Liverpool for a medical.\nPSV and @LFC have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of Cody Gakpo. The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

Just when it looked like Manchester United were going to sign Cody Gakpo, it appears their bitter rivals Liverpool are set to swoop in and sign the Dutch winger.\nHis current club, PSV Eindhoven, have confirmed an agreement has been reached and Gakpo is heading to Liverpool for a medical.\nPSV and @LFC have reached an agreement on the proposed transfer of Cody Gakpo. The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. I think as a group, the sky is the limit. We want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all.\u201d\nJuly 1 \u2013 Mohamed Salah signs new Liverpool deal\nSo, updating the note below\u2026\nIt\u2019s a three-year deal for Salah, who will join holdovers Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino in addition to new signing Darwin Nunez in chasing down Manchester City.\nRead more here\nThe incredible journey continues \ud83d\ude0d#SalahStays \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) July 1, 2022\nJune 25 \u2013 Liverpool open to selling Salah this summer\nLiverpool are reportedly open to selling Mohamed Salah this summer as the Egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. The fact that he\u2019s joining FC Bayern shows that our club and he have big aims.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham. (JPW)\nJuly 7 \u2013 Joe Gomez signs long-term contract extension\nJoe Gomez might not be a first- (or second-) choice center back for Liverpool anymore, with Ibrahima Konate and Joel Matip both out-appearing him last season, but the 25-year-old is keen to continue his seven-year stay an Anfield. Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. I think as a group, the sky is the limit. We want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all.\u201d\nJuly 1 \u2013 Mohamed Salah signs new Liverpool deal\nSo, updating the note below\u2026\nIt\u2019s a three-year deal for Salah, who will join holdovers Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino in addition to new signing Darwin Nunez in chasing down Manchester City.\nRead more here\nThe incredible journey continues \ud83d\ude0d#SalahStays \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) July 1, 2022\nJune 25 \u2013 Liverpool open to selling Salah this summer\nLiverpool are reportedly open to selling Mohamed Salah this summer as the Egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. The fact that he\u2019s joining FC Bayern shows that our club and he have big aims. Sadio Man\u00e9 fits perfectly with the football that FC Bayern play under Julian Nagelsmann.\u201d (NM)\nJune 22 \u2013 Liverpool, Monaco agree transfer fee for Takumi Minamino\nTakumi Minamino\u2019s time at Anfield appears to be over after Liverpool and Monaco reportedly agreed a transfer fee for the 27-year-old Japan international. The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

This asks more questions of Mohamed Salah, who is entering the final year of his deal at Anfield (NM).\nJune 14 \u2013 Darwin Nunez unveiled by Liverpool\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is excited by the potential of his latest massive purchase, especially because possible nine-figure striker Darwin Nunez is already very, very good.\n\u201cDarwin is a wonderful player; already really good but so much potential to get even better,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting, to be honest.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit. (JPW)\nJune 8 \u2013 Reds ready to break their transfer record for Darwin Nunez\nJurgen Klopp could bring Uruguayan center forward Darwin Nunez to Anfield as the Reds continue to spend as much as much as the next guy. The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee. Reports out of Portugal say that Liverpool has met that $106 million fee.

It\u2019ll be $85 million upfront, with the remaining $22 million available through add-ons. (AE)\nJune 7 \u2013 Liverpool reject opening bid from Bayern Munich for Sadio Mane\nBayern Munich reportedly offered $26 million (plus $5 million in add-ons) for Sadio Mane, but the Bundesliga giants were quickly turned away by Liverpool. Bayern will no doubt be back with another offer, though they hope to cap their costs at around $50 million. (AE)\nMay 31 \u2013 Darwin Nunez on Liverpool\u2019s radar\nAccording to a report from FootballTransfers, Uruguayan forward Darwin Nunez, 22, is a target for the Reds this summer. After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

We may find out on at least one count.\nBarella, 26, came up through the ranks at Cagliari before moving to Inter in 2020.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar. (NM)\nJanuary 17 \u2013 Ruben Neves continues to be linked with Liverpool\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a transfer window if Ruben Neves wasn\u2019t linked with a move away from Wolves, would it? The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

We look outside as well. It\u2019s not that we are stubborn and think, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019ll go with these boys until 2050.\u2019 That\u2019s not how we see it.\u201d\nKlopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers.\n\u201cWe are underperforming, definitely. I know that but I cannot sit here and blame everyone else. The players, it is my responsibility that they perform. It\u2019s my first concern, my first job to do. \u2026 Yes, we have to strengthen. Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

The 23-year-old attacker will leave for England imminently where he will be subjected to the necessary formalities ahead of the completion of the transfer. \u2014 PSV (@PSV) December 26, 2022\nAn initial report from The Times said the talks were \u2018advanced\u2019 as they look to pip their rivals to sign the Dutch star who was excellent at the World Cup. The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham. (JPW)\nJuly 7 \u2013 Joe Gomez signs long-term contract extension\nJoe Gomez might not be a first- (or second-) choice center back for Liverpool anymore, with Ibrahima Konate and Joel Matip both out-appearing him last season, but the 25-year-old is keen to continue his seven-year stay an Anfield. Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead. I think as a group, the sky is the limit. We want to go one, if not two, better than last season and aim for it all.\u201d\nJuly 1 \u2013 Mohamed Salah signs new Liverpool deal\nSo, updating the note below\u2026\nIt\u2019s a three-year deal for Salah, who will join holdovers Diogo Jota, Luis Diaz, Roberto Firmino in addition to new signing Darwin Nunez in chasing down Manchester City.\nRead more here\nThe incredible journey continues \ud83d\ude0d#SalahStays \u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) July 1, 2022\nJune 25 \u2013 Liverpool open to selling Salah this summer\nLiverpool are reportedly open to selling Mohamed Salah this summer as the Egyptian star has just one year left on his current contract. The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years. (JPW)\nJune 22 \u2013 Sadio Mane unveiled by Bayern Munich\nBayern Munich is claiming Sadio Mane as a coup for its club and league after the Bundesliga champions unveiled the 30-year-old on Wednesday.\nHere\u2019s Bayern board member Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107:\n\u201cIn Sadio Mane a top international star is coming to FC Bayern, who has left his mark on world football. We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure. The fact that he\u2019s joining FC Bayern shows that our club and he have big aims. Sadio Man\u00e9 fits perfectly with the football that FC Bayern play under Julian Nagelsmann.\u201d (NM)\nJune 22 \u2013 Liverpool, Monaco agree transfer fee for Takumi Minamino\nTakumi Minamino\u2019s time at Anfield appears to be over after Liverpool and Monaco reportedly agreed a transfer fee for the 27-year-old Japan international. The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

This asks more questions of Mohamed Salah, who is entering the final year of his deal at Anfield (NM).\nJune 14 \u2013 Darwin Nunez unveiled by Liverpool\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is excited by the potential of his latest massive purchase, especially because possible nine-figure striker Darwin Nunez is already very, very good.\n\u201cDarwin is a wonderful player; already really good but so much potential to get even better,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting, to be honest. His age, his desire, his hunger to be even better than he currently is.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit. (JPW)\nJune 8 \u2013 Reds ready to break their transfer record for Darwin Nunez\nJurgen Klopp could bring Uruguayan center forward Darwin Nunez to Anfield as the Reds continue to spend as much as much as the next guy. The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee. Reports out of Portugal say that Liverpool has met that $106 million fee.

It\u2019ll be $85 million upfront, with the remaining $22 million available through add-ons. (AE)\nJune 7 \u2013 Liverpool reject opening bid from Bayern Munich for Sadio Mane\nBayern Munich reportedly offered $26 million (plus $5 million in add-ons) for Sadio Mane, but the Bundesliga giants were quickly turned away by Liverpool. Bayern will no doubt be back with another offer, though they hope to cap their costs at around $50 million. (AE)\nMay 31 \u2013 Darwin Nunez on Liverpool\u2019s radar\nAccording to a report from FootballTransfers, Uruguayan forward Darwin Nunez, 22, is a target for the Reds this summer. After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

We may find out on at least one count.\nBarella, 26, came up through the ranks at Cagliari before moving to Inter in 2020.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar. (NM)\nJanuary 17 \u2013 Ruben Neves continues to be linked with Liverpool\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a transfer window if Ruben Neves wasn\u2019t linked with a move away from Wolves, would it? The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

We look outside as well. It\u2019s not that we are stubborn and think, \u2018That\u2019s it. We\u2019ll go with these boys until 2050.\u2019 That\u2019s not how we see it.\u201d\nKlopp said he forgave the reporters because he knows they are being asked by their bosses to ask about transfers.\n\u201cWe are underperforming, definitely. I know that but I cannot sit here and blame everyone else. The players, it is my responsibility that they perform. It\u2019s my first concern, my first job to do. \u2026 Yes, we have to strengthen. Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

We\u2019re proud to have brought him to Munich. Sadio made it clear from the first minute in our talks that he now only wanted to play for FC Bayern. Everyone knows his outstanding technical qualities as well as his incredible mentality. He will contribute a lot and help to lead our team, which has a great structure.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

The 22-year-old Nunez is going to cost significantly more than Manchester City paid for Erling Haaland, who had a release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract.\nLiverpool paid Southampton $94 million to acquire Virgil van Dijk. Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

Oh yes, but is the right time to do it? I can\u2019t see it because of the situation we are in.\n\u201cI think I know exactly how the situation is and that\u2019s it pretty much.

(NM)\nDecember 29 \u2013 Liverpool linked with Moises Caicedo as Brighton sets big price\nBrighton and Hove Albion\u2019s strong and inexpensive midfield is the envy of much of the Premier League, but the latter adjective makes Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s club vulnerable to big-money suitors.\nThat\u2019s going to be a problem as clubs like Liverpool look to strengthen in the January transfer window, and a \u201cliked\u201d Instagram post by one Moises Caicedo is fueling the transfer rumor mill this Thursday.\nLiverpool\u2019s said to want the ever-energetic 21-year-old Ecuadorian to help rejuvenate an aging unit led by Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, and Thiago Alcantara.\nCaicedo learning from Fabinho could be a match made in Anfield heaven for Jurgen Klopp, and the young, fierce midfielder could also take some lessons from Jordan Henderson.\nThe pay packet rise and Champions League opportunities would make the minute dip worth the sacrifice for Caicedo, and this one could cost $30-40 million less than Enzo Fernandez.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

The 23-year-old is expected to travel to Liverpool for a medical soon and according to The Athletic an initial fee of close to $45 million has been agreed with PSV Eindhoven for Gakpo.\nWhere would Gakpo slot in at Liverpool? With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

(AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker.

Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

It\u2019s not like, \u2018Today is not good and now we have to change.\u2019 This is clear, it was always clear. This team has a wonderful history. The way this club is led is by not splashing the money and having a look at if it works out or not. Our transfers always have to be on point. So that makes it really tricky where we cannot make four transfers before we know who will leave the club.\n\u201cLast year was not a season for a big change. We played until the last moment. If you want to change again, this club, we can\u2019t just bring in new players and then realise later, \u2018Oh, nobody wants to leave.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work like that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not possible to start it early because we had final after final after final. Played the season until the last minute, played the Champions League final. Then we had a short break, then we have a lot of injuries, and then the World Cup.\n\u201cAll the problems we knew we would have, this came on top. And now we are in it and I know it\u2019s too long. For me it\u2019s too long because I have to always face you in the press conferences. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to talk about it all the time. But I have to think it all the time. But that\u2019s not as bad as talking about it to be honest, because I don\u2019t have to read it the next day. That\u2019s the situation, I cannot change it.\n\u201cNow the people are not happy. We try to fight through and make the best of this season, that\u2019s the idea. And stay in the period as good as a person as you can. If I said, the better you behave in the moment like this, the better the times will be after it. The more useful the bad times are because they have to be useful otherwise they are completely useless.\n\u201cBut based on the way this club is led. It\u2019s obviously different to other clubs, that\u2019s how it is. But it worked out so far and we have to see if it will work still or if we have to adapt. Let me say it like that. But that\u2019s something for us in the offices, when we are not in the training pitch. And for us, from my conversations with the owners. But that\u2019s it, nothing else. It\u2019s just work.\u201d\nGot it? No? Exactly. Jurgen Klopp needs the summer transfer window to get here, that\u2019s for sure. But to say that reaching finals stops them from planning for the future is either an uninspired excuse or an indictment on the brains of every one inside of Liverpool including Klopp himself. The wise money is on the weak excuse. He\u2019s one of the most impressive man motivators, tacticians, and soccer minds of his generation. Certainly he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nIt also has to be exhausting to a coach to be outperforming teams but not finishing chances while also making uncharacteristic (in previous seasons) gaffes at the other end. Liverpool is still third in expected goals but is hemorrhaging xGA. It certainly looks like Klopp bet on a handful of mainstays to hold off Father Time for one more season and Father Time was like, \u201cNah.\u201d And being asked about transfers by journalists might be annoying, but it sure isn\u2019t the worst job on Earth, is it?

One thing that hasn\u2019t often been mentioned about owner Todd Boehly\u2019s big spending is the need to satisfy those who are currently in blue.\nMount would bridge the gulf between old and young midfielders at Liverpool, but how much money would he cost given his status as an England national team player and moving to a direct rival (but also Chelsea\u2019s desire to balance their books)?\nJuventus is also linked by The Guardian and Chelsea is said to be readying a new contract offer for Mount\u2026 but just something to put onto your radar.

The Portuguese midfielder is currently the skipper at Molineux and is leading their charge up the table after the appointment of Julen Lopetegui. Per a report from Football Insider, Liverpool want to sign Neves this month as his contract has just over a year left on it. That means Wolves would still get a very big transfer fee for him, but nowhere near the previous $120 million they were quoting clubs.\nGiven Liverpool\u2019s struggles in central midfield this season, it is believed Jude Bellingham is their preferred long-term target. They probably needs Neves and Bellingham together to rejuvenate their midfield and push them back towards the top four, at the very least. Can we see this happening? It would be pretty crazy for Wolves to sell Neves this month as they battle against relegation. That said, if the offer is big enough then they could sell.

He is still only 23 years old but he already has a lot of experience. He was the captain of PSV, he was the Player of the Year in Holland last season and, as a lot of people have just seen, he also had a great World Cup with his national team. So, it is clear that he is already a really, really good player but his age also means he also has the potential to become even better. Offensively, he is very versatile and on top of this we know he is a smart footballer and also a smart person, so we are really excited to be able to work with him.\u201d There could hardly be a better time for this move whether you\u2019re discussing in terms of the club or the player. Injuries to Luis Diaz and others have opened the door for a strong player to make an instant impact, and Gakpo certainly showed at the World Cup that he\u2019s on his game.

With Liverpool already having Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in attack, this is going to be intriguing. Gakpo, Nunez and Diaz will be Liverpool\u2019s front three for the next five years plus if all goes well, and that is a trio full of trickery, intensity, clinical finishing and directness. This is a surprising move by Liverpool but it slots in superbly with their recruitment model and Gakpo seems to be the kind of player who is ready to break out in a big way and score 20 plus goals a season in the Premier League. Just like they did with Luis Diaz, Liverpool have snuck in ahead of their rivals. (JPW)\nDecember 22 \u2013 Huge offer to arrive for Argentine star Enzo Fernandez?\nWith Liverpool linked continuously with Jude Bellingham and the quartet of Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara either in or approaching the twilight of their careers, it appears Liverpool\u2019s main need is in central midfield.\nThat is where Enzo Fernandez comes in. The 21-year-old midfielder announced himself to the world at the World Cup as he scored and created goals, snapped into tackles and his driving runs all contributed to him being named the young player of the tournament. In many ways he and Bellingham are very similar players. According to the latest report from Record in Portugal, Benfica have rejected a $105 million bid from an unnamed club for Fernandez. His release clause is said to be around $126 million.\nWhen you think about his qualities as a player, Fernandez would perfectly slot into this Liverpool side. They haven\u2019t been shy about splashing the cash on players needed in key areas of the pitch in the past (Virgil van Dijk and Alisson prove that) and Fernandez slots into that category as Liverpool\u2019s midfield needs strengthening and his signing would allow them to be pretty settled for the next four to five years. Yes, it\u2019s a lot of money for Fernandez and they may pay a premium due to his displays at the World Cup. But he\u2019s still cheaper than Bellingham.

Gomez signed a five-year contract through the summer of 2027. Gomez has since spoken to the club\u2019s website:(AE)\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a special moment for me and my family. Another one that you dream of as a kid, and one I don\u2019t take for granted. \u201cIt is an unbelievable place to be. In my eyes, probably one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 clubs in the world at the minute. The opportunity to extend my stay here was an easy decision to make, really. \u201cObviously, I have been here quite a while now, but in the grand scheme of things I still feel young and, like you say, the best years are ahead of me. I have got more to learn and the time to do that. \u201cI think I have the platform here to do it with the manager and the coaching staff around me and my teammates, to make sure the best years are ahead.

The Reds have been locked in talks with Salah for months about a new deal and per a report from the The Sun, Liverpool could sell Salah this summer for $74 million. Per the report, Real Madrid are the club Salah could move to as they look to bolster their attack after missing out on Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland this summer.\nShould Liverpool cash-in on Salah just like they did with Sadio Mane earlier this week? With one year left on his contract and no real movement on talks, the situation is pretty similar and Salah has won everything he can at Liverpool. With Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz arriving over the last six months at Anfield, it feels like Liverpool have already made the moves to replace Mane and Salah long-term. Now it\u2019s all about whether they sell Salah this summer or risk him running down his contract and leaving for free next summer. The latter option would not be good for Liverpool from a business sense, especially as they\u2019ve been very good in terms of net spend and bringing in like-for-like replacements over the last six years.

The fee is said to be just shy of $16 million, with an additional $3 million possible in add-ons. After signing Minamino for $9 million two and a half years ago, Liverpool are set to make a small profit in the deal (plus any loan fee they received from Southampton in 2021. (AE)\nJune 21 \u2013 Sadio Mane arrives in Munich ahead of move to Bayern\nThe Senegal star is inching closer to his move to Bayern Munich as he is in Bavaria for his medical. Mane, 30, will soon become a Bayern player after the clubs agreed a fee of over $43 million. Liverpool fans will be sad to see these scenes but Mane leaves a legend as he scored 120 goals in 269 games for the Reds and epitomized what they were all about under Jurgen Klopp. At Bayern he will be the main man (Robert Lewandowski is expected to leave) and it felt like he was keen to have a fresh challenge in his career after winning every trophy possible with Liverpool over the last six seasons. Mane\u2019s incredible consistency, intensity and quality will be tough to replace and he will always be a hero at Anfield.

Ramsay was wanted by plenty of Premier League clubs but Liverpool\u2019s pull was too strong and given Jurgen Klopp\u2019s record of nurturing young talent (Harvey Elliott, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Curtis Jones to name a few) this move makes a lot of sense.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a pathway here \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons I chose it as well. It\u2019s not just a massive club, they give young players chances in the first team,\u201d Ramsay said.\n\u201cSo if I can come in in pre-season, put my mark down, then there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t push to get in the first-team squad.\u201d\nRamsay has been sensational for Aberdeen in the Scottish Premiership and is a Scotland U21 international already.

Per the report, Liverpool will pay Benfica a guaranteed $84 million and could pay up to another $21 million in add-ons. After being on international duty with Uruguay over the last few weeks, Nunez left Uruguay\u2019s camp and has flown to Madrid, Spain and is set to travel to England to complete his medical and sign the contract on Monday.\nDarwin Nunez impressed Klopp when Liverpool played against Benfica (Nunez scored in each leg) and is a rising star in world soccer. His aggression, clinical finishing and pace mean he is perfect for this Liverpool team and will slot in well alongside Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah (at least for next season) up top. Liverpool don\u2019t mess around once they identify a player they want to sign and Nunez ticks all of the boxes Jurgen Klopp wants from a striker. This deal make so much sense it\u2019s almost too perfect of a fit.

Benfica\u2019s asking price for Nunez is said to start at $106 million, with Manchester United and Atletico Madrid among those also in the discussion and capable of raising the fee.

After a superb season at Benfica the center forward is a wanted man as Manchester United, Newcastle, Real Madrid and several of Europe\u2019s top clubs are chasing his signature. With Sadio Mane looking to be on his way out and question marks over the future of Mohamed Salah, Klopp may need to strengthen this attack this summer. After bringing in Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota over the last 12 months, Liverpool have strength in-depth but Nunez would give them something very different in attack with his hold-up play, runs in-behind and ability to run the channels from a central position.

The 70-year-old \u2014 bald, his former wrestler\u2019s frame rounded out and stooped \u2014 lived on a street of identical houses topped with terra-cotta roofs and fronted by gravel yards, occasionally chatting with neighbors as he walked his black Lab. He had put 2,500 miles between himself and the allegations that shadowed his name in New Jersey.\n\u201cYou never know who your neighbors are,\u201d a local resident told Las Vegas\u2019s Fox 5 this week.\nWhen Capparelli failed to appear for a few days this month, Henderson police officers conducted a wellness check at his house Saturday morning. They found Capparelli dead on his kitchen floor, according to Fox 5. He had been shot through the neck. The death was ruled a homicide.\nIn Henderson, the death initially made headlines as the third homicide notched in the city of 300,000 this year. Back east, however, Capparelli\u2019s killing detonated with considerably more shock.\nAdvertisement\nA Catholic priest from 1980 to 1992, Capparelli had been accused by at least two dozen men of sexual misconduct. The allegations included groping and forcing young men to wrestle in swimsuits while he photographed the encounters, according to NJ.com. Even after he was suspended from the church in 1992, Capparelli continued working with children as a public school teacher.\nThat career came to an abrupt end in 2011, when the Star-Ledger reported on the past allegations against the ex-priest, and also revealed his ties to the operation of a fetish website. He was never criminally charged with any wrongdoing and always maintained his innocence.\nBut Capparelli\u2019s past continued to haunt him until this year. Last month, New Jersey\u2019s five Catholic dioceses released a list of 188 members of the clergy who were \u201ccredibly accused\u201d of child abuse. Capparelli was included.\nAdvertisement\nA month later, he was killed in Nevada, where he had been living since 2016. Authorities in Henderson have not released any details about possible suspects or motives. The ex-priest\u2019s death comes as dioceses nationwide begin to excavate decades of abuse allegations and coverups.\n\u201cThe world is a safer place without him,\u201d Rich Fitter, one of Capparelli\u2019s accusers, told NJ.com. \u201cThe guy had a 40-year record of abuse. Whatever lead to his death, it\u2019s a certain amount of karma.\u201d\n\u201cThe murder of the former priest John Capparelli is shocking and sad,\u201d Robert Hoatson, the head of sexual abuse survivor nonprofit Road to Recovery who has treated some of the ex-priest\u2019s alleged victims, told USA Today. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we want people to be handled. We want them to go through the proper procedures. We hope the victims are taking care of themselves and that the murderer is brought to justice.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the list released by the church in February, Capparelli was ordained in 1980 and served at a number of parishes and as a teacher at parochial schools throughout the 1980s.\nFitter told the Star-Ledger in 2011 that his abuse began when he was on the wrestling team at Oratory Preparatory School in Summit, N.J., in the early 1980s.\n\u201cSadistic is probably a pretty good word to use,\u201d Fitter told the paper. \u201cThere were times he would grab your genitals and squeeze.\u201d\nFitter alleged that Capparelli took sexual satisfaction out of aggressively wrestling with students. \u201cHe would put a head scissors on you, and your face would be right in front of his crotch,\u201d Fitter told the paper.\nA second accuser, Chris Nolan, told the Star-Ledger that when he was an eighth-grader at a parish school where Capparelli taught, the priest pressured him into taking part in \u201csubmission wrestling.\u201d Nolan, who told the paper he was never groped by Capparelli, did say he was suspicious because the priest allegedly handed out Speedo bathing suits to the boys, then photographed them while they wrestled.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the Star-Ledger, a third accuser, Andrew Dundorf, filed a lawsuit against Capparelli in July 2011 alleging he was abused by the priest for more than a decade, including at trips to Disney World and a Boy Scouts camp where Capparelli worked. (The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.)\nIn 1989, following complaints about his behavior with boys, Capparelli was sent to a New Mexico treatment center that specialized in alcoholism and pedophilia, the Star-Ledger uncovered in 2011. In 1992, the Archdiocese of Newark suspended Capparelli.\nBut a year later, he was back in the classroom, teaching math to ninth-graders at a Newark public school.\nAfter the paper first reported on the past allegations against Capparelli in October 2011, two dozen additional accusers stepped forward with their own complaints about the ex-priest\u2019s behavior. The paper also later linked Capparelli to a fetish website he was running out of his home that featured young men wrestling in Speedo-style bathing suits.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2013, Capparelli agreed to a settlement with the New Jersey State Board of Examiners that resulted in the revocation of his teaching certificate. His attorney said at the time the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing and allowed Capparelli to keep his pension from his $96,000 annual teaching salary.\n\u201cHe had a great career in Newark, and now he has a chance to retire with dignity,\u201d his attorney told the Star-Ledger.\nThe same year, the Catholic church laicized \u2014 or officially expelled \u2014 Capparelli from the church.\nAuthorities in Nevada said the investigation into the killing continues. But for Capparelli\u2019s alleged victims, the death settles nothing.\n\u201cI always wanted him to be held accountable,\u201d Fitter told 8 News NOW Las Vegas on Tuesday. \u201cI knew I would never get an apology from him.\u201d\nMore from Morning Mix:\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "sid": 5, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "7824236292265918133", "docid": 0, "url": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/01/22/reproductive-health-act-new-york-legislature-gov-andrew-cuomo-roe-v-wade/", "ms_text": "M___: E________: N__ S_____ M_______ L_____ S______-C______ S___ D___ W___ C___\nN__ Y___ l________ a_______ i_ 1___, t____ y____ b_____ t__ S______ C____ d_______ i_ R__ v.

Bam Adebayo's 19 points led the Heat but their leading scorer Josh Richardson was held to just eight points \u2013 it was just the sixth time this season that he failed to reach double digits.\nFrom Toronto's hot start to the significance of its big win, here are some takeaways from Sunday's game\u2026\n3-point shooting sets the tone\nAn early start to the game didn't keep the Raptors from coming out of the gates firing; the team shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc in the first quarter and got out to a 32-27 lead after one.\nBy the half, Toronto had eclipsed its season average of 11.7 made 3-pointers per game as it entered the break having connected on 12 of its 21 3-point attempts while Miami had hit just three. The Raptors used their hot shooting to take a 68-54 lead into the break\nSunday afternoon marked the 14th time this season that Toronto scored 65 or more points in the first half and it is now 13-1 in such games.\nThe Raptors finished the night tying a franchise record by hitting 21 3-pointers and did so at a 52.5 percent clip, outscoring the Heat 63-24 from deep. The deep ball is a key that can unlock the capabilities of Nurse's offence and Toronto is 11-2 when hitting 15 or more this season.\nSharpening the rotation\nWith Kawhi Leonard sidelined for the 19th time this season, Nick Nurse elected to put Patrick McCaw into the starting unit \u2013 a calculated decision.\nAlthough Fred VanVleet is still a few weeks away from returning, McCaw starting meant that the Raptors rotation largely remained intact. Only 15 games stand between Toronto and its sixth-consecutive postseason appearance, and depth can prove to be the team's advantage as it looks to make a deep run.\nWith Marc Gasol now one month into his tenure with the Raptors and Jeremy Lin just completing his ninth game with the team, the more time this duo spends getting acclimated with the rest of the second unit, the better.\nNorman Powell's 15 points led the reserves, who finished the night with 46 points. As the team returns to full strength, the bench could very well propel the Raptors to a few playoff wins.\nSloppy play\nTo find a flaw in today's performance from the Raptors might possibly be nitpicking, but the team's 21 turnovers could be a cause for concern.\nLed by Lowry's six, Toronto committed over 20 turnovers for just the fifth time this season; interestingly enough, the team has won four of the five games that it has given the ball away over 20 times.\nTwo of the five games were early afternoon matinees.\nThe Raptors were fortunate in that the Heat were only able to convert the 21 turnovers into 16 points, but Toronto's chances of playing an early afternoon game in the playoffs are rather high. While shooting wasn't a problem today, taking care of the ball needs to be a priority for this team when there's an early tip.\nTaking care of business\nWith the win, the Raptors advance to 28-3 this season in games against teams under .500.\nIt wasn't a tight win, either \u2013 Toronto entered the final frame up 12 points and cruised to a 21-point win. The benefit of earning such a convincing win on the first end of a back-to-back is the fact that a number of players were granted extra rest.\nKyle Lowry played a team-high 35 minutes of action, but starters Danny Green, Serge Ibaka, and Pascal Siakam sat out the entire fourth quarter, which is also a product of the bench's exemplary play.\n11 of the Raptors 15 remaining games are against below-.500 opponents.

They'll have an opportunity to tighten that gap on Sunday, when they host a Toronto Raptors team that'll be without Kawhi Leonard, who will miss his 19th game of the season due to load management.\nOnly the Detroit Pistons and Houston Rockets have a better net rating than the Heat over the last six games. They've beaten the Nets, Golden State Warriors, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets and Cleveland Cavaliers during that stretch, their only loss coming to the Rockets in a game in which James Harden exploded for 58 points.\nNow back in the lineup after missing most of the season with a knee injury, Goran Dragic has given the Heat a huge boost in his return. He's scored 20-plus points in two of his last three appearances, including 27 points in 20 minutes off the bench in their win over the Warriors.\n\"You see that he brings something off the dribble that we need,\" Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said of Dragic following their latest win.\nKelly Olynyk has also stepped up for the Heat with an average of 18.3 points on 59.3 percent shooting from 3-point range in his last six games. He's been the team's second-leading scorer, trailing only Dragic.\nNotes\nDwyane Wade continues to play well for the Heat in his final season. He averaged 15.8 points per game in the month of February and is posting 13.0 points and 5.0 assists through four games this month.\nWade will play his final regular season game in Toronto next month, on April 7.\nKawhi Leonard will miss his 19th game of the season on Sunday. The Raptors are 13-5 in games he has missed this season, with multiple players stepping up in his absence.\nJeremy Lin is coming off of his best game as a member of the Raptors.

Kyle Lowry finished with a triple-double, Serge Ibaka blocked five shots and Pascal Siakam was their second-leading scorer with 19 points.\nThe Raptors are 2-0 against the Heat this season.

Butts Jr., law enforcement sources told The Times.\nButts was attempting to make a left turn onto the USC campus, possibly against a red light, when his vehicle was struck by another car, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the case with the media.\nButts\u2019 vehicle then spun and collided with the sergeant, whose motorcycle was parked on the sidewalk. The force of the collision sent both the sergeant and his motorcycle into a nearby fountain, the law enforcement official said.\nAdvertisement\nThe crash is under investigation. No one has been cited in the incident at this time.\nButts could not be reached for comment by phone, text message or email, and one of the mayor\u2019s assistants declined to comment.\nOfficer Jeff Lee, an LAPD spokesman, said a sergeant from the department\u2019s Central Traffic Division was injured when he was struck by another vehicle near the intersection of Exposition Boulevard and Figueroa Street at 8:47 a.m.\nThe sergeant\u2019s motorcycle was stationary at the time. He was taken to a hospital in stable condition, according to Lee, who said the other driver stayed at the scene. No one else was injured.\nLee declined to comment on Butts\u2019 involvement and referred additional questions to Inglewood officials. LAPD Capt. Gisselle Espinoza, a department spokeswoman, confirmed the vehicle that struck the officer was registered to the city of Inglewood.\nThe accident occurred when a black sport utility vehicle made a left turn, and a gray Honda traveling west struck the SUV as the SUV was negotiating the turn. The impact caused the SUV to hit the motor officer who was stopped in front of the water fountain, Espinoza said.\nSources said the sergeant suffered several broken bones after being struck by the SUV.\nDavid Carlisle, assistant chief of USC\u2019s Department of Public Safety, said the crash occurred near the Pardee Way entrance to campus and tied up traffic in the area all day. No students were involved in the incident, Carlisle said, adding the LAPD will solely handle the investigation.\nA USC employee who asked to remain anonymous said she was walking from the bus stop to campus when she heard the screech of brakes and tires and a bang. She looked up and saw a gray sedan and a black SUV in the street.\nThe SUV then slammed into a stationary police motorcycle, pinning it against the fountain.\n\u201cI see an officer in the fountain and people run up and try to help him, but they can\u2019t move him because he\u2019s really injured,\u201d the employee said.\n\u201cIf he hadn\u2019t had his helmet on, he would be dead,\u201d she added.\nThe USC employee said she ran to the female driver of the sedan, who was sitting on the curb with her young child, visibly shaken.\nShe said that she also saw a man in a suit who she thought had been driving the SUV, and that the airbag had deployed. She believed he was the only person in the car.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, thank you, thank you.\u2019\u201d\nThe woman driving the sedan had only minor injuries. As she sat with the USC employee, she described how she had been driving west on Exposition Boulevard when the SUV made a left turn into her car onto the USC Pardee Way driveway.\n\u201cShe told me, \u2018I was driving to day care.

On a few occasions, some members of his inner circle were convinced he was ready to pull the trigger, only to find it did not happen. Year-end family discussions about a potential run did not end the process, which people around Biden describe as intensely personal for the former vice president.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just treading water, but I don\u2019t know how close we are to the shore,\u201d said a person familiar with the planning process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\nAs Biden has deliberated, other campaign professionals who had previously expressed interest in joining his effort have decided they can no longer wait.

Hillary Clinton, they note, did not announce her campaign until April 2015.\nThere are few modern-day parallels for someone like Biden \u2014 a man who has been considered a top-tier presidential candidate over such a long period, who almost always considers it and sometimes also runs.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cJoe has certainly taken it seriously and gone through the process and knows what it feels like,\u201d said Larry Rasky, who has known Biden for decades and worked on both of his presidential campaigns. \u201cWhen it feels right and when it feels wrong.\u201d\nOther candidates have run multiple times \u2014 William Jennings Bryan in 1896, 1900 and 1908, and former California governor Jerry Brown in 1976, 1980 and 1992.

He\u2019s a bit unusual in the sense that he\u2019s had a very long career in American politics, has always been relevant, often is a front-page news story,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian. \u201cThere seems to be a constant question of, \u2018What\u2019s Joe going to do?\u2019 He\u2019s always plausible.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe downside is he always seems to be hemming and hawing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to develop momentum when you\u2019re fence-sitting.\u201d\nThe first time Biden weighed whether to run for president was in 1980, when a group of consultants approached him and outlined a case for his candidacy: President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy would so bruise each other in the Democratic primary that he could emerge as the compromise candidate. A network was awaiting him in New Hampshire.\nUltimately, he took a pass.\nFour years later, he went so far as to sign filing papers to compete in the New Hampshire primary, leaving them with his sister Valerie while he went on a vacation. On the flight to the Virgin Islands, he and Jill discussed the possibilities. By Biden\u2019s retelling, he wasn\u2019t convinced he was ready and, as soon as the plane touched down, he called his sister and told her not to file the paperwork.\nAdvertisement\nIn 1988, he openly struggled with the decision, telling reporters over and over that his time on the campaign trail would take away from his ability to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Just before announcing he was running, he later wrote, he confessed to his wife that he didn\u2019t want to do it. She urged him to go forward with it, given how many people\u2019s lives he had put on hold.\n\u201cJill, who had been so wary, had come to appreciate the sacrifices other people were making on our behalf,\u201d Biden wrote in his 2007 memoir, \u201cPromises to Keep.\u201d \u201cIt was too late to change my mind.\u201d\nBut his campaign struggled and less than four months after he got in, he dropped out, over allegations that he plagiarized a speech from a British politician.\nThose who have known Biden over the years say he felt pulled into the 1988 campaign, listening more to those around him than his gut instincts, and the experience made him gun-shy. For the next several presidential campaigns, he did not consider running.\nHe spent months in deliberation over whether he would run in 2004, with those around him growing exasperated by his delays and with him growing exasperated by their exasperation.\n\u201cIf I do this, I\u2019m not going to do this on anybody\u2019s terms but my own this time,\u201d Biden told Gannett News Service. \u201cIf it\u2019s too late, it\u2019s too late. So be it.\u201d\nHe never got in. He ran in 2008 but dropped out following a 1 percent finish in the Iowa caucuses. His political career was revived that same year when he became Obama\u2019s vice president.\nAhead of the 2016 campaign, he was deeply conflicted and mourning the death of his son Beau. He ultimately announced in the Rose Garden that he would not run.\n\u201cI regret it every day,\u201d he said later.\nSome who have spoken recently with Biden say he is leaning toward a run but the decision is not firm enough to ask for commitments from donors or political activists. Biden also has told other candidates not to wait for him as they make their decisions.\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s ready, he\u2019s ready,\u201d said one confidant. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to be rushed. And the older he\u2019s gotten, the less he likes to be rushed. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.

Yet, Toyota is determined to keep the thing alive for at least another year, and it'll do so with a flashy new Heritage Edition celebrating one big milestone.\nToyota on Wednesday unveiled the 2020 Land Cruiser Heritage Edition, meant to celebrate the SUV's 60th anniversary. While it was unveiled digitally this week, it'll be shown to the public for the first time at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show in early February.\nThe Heritage Edition is only available as a two-row SUV, ditching the Land Cruiser's optional third row in favor of cargo capacity. The exterior can be had in either black or white, and it's adorned with a new grille, vintage Land Cruiser exterior badging and a set of 18-inch BBS alloy wheels in bronze. The headlights, fog lights and side mirrors all have darker elements than usual. The running boards and lower chrome moldings have been removed in favor of improved off-road performance.\nEnlarge Image Toyota\nToyota gussied up the interior with a whole bunch of black leather-trimmed upholstery, borrowing the wheels' bronze color for the contrast stitching that reaches to the wheel, door trim and seats. There's also a set of all-weather floor mats and a cargo liner thrown in for good measure. Otherwise... that's about it, save for the deletion of the refrigerated \"cool box.\" There are also loads of features tucked away in here, including ventilated front seats, four-zone climate control and a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system.\nIn terms of powertrain, the story is the same as always. It rocks a 5.7-liter V8 good for 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of torque. All four wheels receive that motive force through an eight-speed automatic transmission and a Torsen limited-slip locking center differential. Low range is along for the ride, too.\nThe 2020 Toyota Land Cruiser Heritage Edition will go on sale this summer, following its debut in Chicago, and it will be limited to just 1,200 units. Pricing will be announced closer to its on-sale date, but for context's sake, a 2019 Land Cruiser will set you back $84,765.\nDetroit Auto Show: While Chicago builds up, check out our recap from Detroit.\nLexus LX: In case you're wondering what a Lexus-branded Land Cruiser would be like.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "13517859795206306195", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/iris-monarrez-details-cristhian-rivera-233429060.html", "ms_text": "V___ p_____\nF_______\nA w____ R_____ w__ o___ r___________ i_______ w___ i_ f______ w___ T_______ a__ s___ o_ h__ f_____ m______ o_ F_______.", "full_text": "Who Is Iris Monarrez?\nWho Is Iris Monarrez?

the transfer window, but does that mean we won't be hearing more about Paul Pogba potentially leaving Manchester United in the near future? No, absolutely not.\nAdvertisement\nThe World Cup-winning midfielder was, reportedly at least, the subject of a cash-plus-players bid from Barcelona earlier this week after further rumours he's unhappy in Manchester following his falling out with Jose Mourinho last season. The Spanish champions are said to have offered \u20ac50 million for the Frenchman, plus central defender Yerry Mina and midfielder Andre Gomes.\nOn top of this, further reports now claim Pogba has agreed personal terms with Barca which would see him earn \u00a3100m over the course of a five-year contract.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of his strained relationship with Mourinho, it's thought United will knock back any offers for Pogba in the coming days. Not only is Pogba of high value to United in a commercial sense, it's unlikely the club would be able to bring in a replacement with the transfer window set to close for English clubs later this week- even though reports in Italy suggest they're desperately trying to agree a move for Lazio's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.\nEven if Pogba remains a United player beyond the end of this week, the fact the transfer window remains open for European clubs for the rest of the month means it's unlikely the speculation linking him with a second move away from Old Trafford will end any time soon.", "sid": 5, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "15409907421889986676", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/17/asia/north-korea-south-korea-summit-intl/index.html", "ms_text": "S____, S____ K____ (C__) N____ K_____ l_____ K__ J___ U_ g______ S____ K_____ P________ M___ J__-i_ o_ h__ a______ i_ P________ T______ f__ t____ t____ s_____ t___ y___, a_ t__ t__ c________ l___ t_ e________ p____ o_ t__ K_____ P________.", "full_text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN \u2014\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un greeted South Korean President Moon Jae-in on his arrival in Pyongyang Tuesday for their third summit this year, as the two countries look to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula.\nThe two leaders smiled and hugged at the foot of Moon\u2019s plane at Sunan International Airport, amid crowds of cheering North Koreans waving flowers and national flags, including those symbolizing a unified Korean Peninsula.\nMoon and Kim and their wives then shook hands with various officials, before reviewing a North Korean ceremonial guard.

Lee, the head of Samsung.\nThough Pyongyang will likely relish the opportunity to court South Korean investors, ongoing nuclear talks between North Korea and the United States are also expected to feature prominently on the agenda.\nThe third meeting comes as the diplomatic efforts to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles appear to have hit an impasse. It\u2019s been three months since US President Donald Trump met Kim in Singapore \u2013 the first-ever summit between the sitting leaders of their two countries \u2013 but there have been no visible steps made by North Korea to suggest it has stopped the development of its nuclear arsenal.\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump and Kim Jong Un's ups and downs 03:23 - Source: CNN\nThe United Nations\u2019 head of political affairs, Rosemary di Carlo, said Monday there are signs North Korea is \u201cstill maintaining and developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, delivered a similar assessment last month when he said the Trump administration does not feel North Korea was living up to its end of the agreement reached between Trump and Kim in Singapore, a page-and-a-half document that critics assailed as too short on specifics.\nThe problem, analysts say, is that North Korea will likely never give up its nuclear weapons unless it has a peaceful and productive relationship with the United States.\nWashington is likely only willing to fundamentally change its relationship with Pyongyang if Kim were to give up his nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles he needs to deliver them.\n\u201cI am willing to talk candidly with Chairman Kim Jong Un to find a balance between the US\u2019 demands for denuclearization and North Korea\u2019s request for dropping hostile policies and enforcing measures to secure their safety,\u201d Moon said Monday.\n\u201cI believe that the denuclearization issue can be progressed at a rapid pace if the two leaders face each other again and talk.\u201d\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, center left, waves as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center right, applauds upon Moon's arrival at Sunan International Airport in Pyongyang Tuesday.

Kevin Lim/The Strait Times/Handout/Getty Images\nRolling out the red carpet\nIf history is any precedent, North Korea will continue to pull out all the stops for Moon and his entourage.\nThe previous two South Korean Presidents who visited North Korea, President Roh Moo-hyun in 2007 and President Kim Dae-jung in 2000, were both given a hero\u2019s welcome.\nKim, the first South Korean leader ever to travel North, won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, but his legacy was tainted after it was revealed that South Korea secretly funneled nearly $200 million dollars to the the North Koreans through the Hyundai corporation just days before the talks.\nKim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in, top; Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong Il, bottom left; and Kim Jong Il and Roh Moo-hyun, bottom right.

Moon\u2019s office said he will also stay at the same venue where Kim Jong Il, the late North Korean leader, hosted Kim Dae-jung and Roh, the Paekhwawon State Guesthouse.\nPhotos of the luxury property emerged in June after Kim Jong Un hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov there. The guesthouse was surrounded by well manicured grass and colorful flowers \u2013 \u201cPaekhwawon\u201d means \u201cgarden of a hundred flowers.\u201d\nBut beyond the pomp and circumstances, it\u2019s unclear if this summit will end in any sort of formal agreement. Moon\u2019s office insists that its important for the two Korean leaders to continue meeting on a regular basis in order to work toward peace.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mean to add another declaration or another agreement,\u201d Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman for Moon, said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re moving towards a new era.\u201d", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "12385209788488195718", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/09/01/analysis-john-mccain-sends-final-rebuke-donald-trump/1172136002/", "ms_text": "S____ P___\nU__ T____\nA_ t__ m_______ s______ h_ h__ c________ p______, J___ M_____ m______ t_ d______ a f____ a__ d______ r_____ t_ t__ m__ w__ w___'t t____, w____ n___ w__ n____ u______.", "full_text": "At the memorial service he had carefully planned, John McCain managed to deliver a final and defiant rebuke to the man who wasn't there, whose name was never uttered.\nPresident Donald Trump was one of the few of the nation's political elite, past and present, who weren't among the more than 3,000 mourners at the National Cathedral for an emotional, affectionate, often humorous and sometimes fierce outpouring in honor of the Arizona senator who was twice defeated in his efforts to win the White House.\nIn what amounted to a statement of fundamental American principles, he had asked the two men who vanquished those aspirations to deliver eulogies: Former President George W. Bush, who won the Republican nomination over McCain in 2000, and former President Barack Obama, who won the presidency against him in 2008.\nMore: Cindy McCain weeps duringpowerful rendition of 'Danny Boy'\nBefore a word was said, his invitation and their acceptance in itself signaled an endorsement of the importance of civility, humility and bipartisanship \u2013 qualities that now seem to be a rare commodity in the capital.\nObama's closing words were among the most direct about the current state of American politics, including the relentless partisanship that divides Congress into competing party fortresses and the divisive rhetoric that has become the signature of the current president.\nMore: Meghan McCain jabs Trump, says 'America was always great'\n\"So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage,\" Obama said. \"It\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough but in fact is born of fear. John called upon us to be bigger than that. He called upon us to be better than that.\"\nSoon after the service had begun, Trump departed the White House dressed for golf and wearing a white \"Make America Great Again\" cap. He already had posted morning tweets denouncing \"the corruption\" of the FBI and the Justice Department. By the time he arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Loudoun County, Virginia, he had tweeted his unhappiness with Canada and his willingness to abandon NAFTA. \"We will be far better off,\" he said of the free-trade agreement.\nThree miles away, at the cathedral, former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman was speaking from the lectern about his departed friend.\nThe message from the cathedral to the president was unmistakable, a declaration of the Washington establishment to the sitting president that was surely unprecedented.\n\"McCain staged his death like the final act of Shakespeare's Richard III, every legitimate force in the state, living and dead, combined against the wicked king,\" tweeted David Frum, a Republican speechwriter in the George W. Bush White House.\nTrump and McCain were members of the same party but, it often seemed, from different worlds. During the 2015 campaign, in a jaw-dropping jab, Trump said McCain was \"not a war hero\" even though he had spent more than five years as a POW in Vietnam. \"I like people that weren't captured,\" Trump said. When McCain died last week of a brain tumor, at age 81, Trump delayed for two days before relenting to criticism and issuing a statement praising him, and ordering American flags left at half-staff until the senator's internment Sunday.\nPresent in the pews were not only three former presidents \u2013 Obama, Bush and Bill Clinton. There were also all four of the national candidates from the bitterly disputed 2000 election \u2013 Bush and Dick Cheney, Al Gore and Lieberman. Others who have felt the pain of losing presidential races were there: Hillary Clinton and John Kerry and Bob Dole. There were at least three Nobel Prize winners. And the current congressional leadership, Republican and Democratic, all of whom had their battles with McCain.\nMost wrenching was the eulogy delivered by Meghan McCain, remarks that were emotional and intense. She spoke with force about her father even as she fought back tears.\n\"We gather to honor the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege,\" she said.\n\"The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great.\"\nWith that, the congregation in the sanctuary broke into applause.\nA few hours later, Trump tweeted again, four words in all capital letters, a sign that he had heard the message from McCain's service and was unpersuaded. \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" he posted.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "14810198805720026438", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/30/who-lucy-flores-who-has-accused-joe-biden-sexual-harassment/3319322002/", "ms_text": "B____ M________\nR___ G______ J______\nR___, N__.", "full_text": "RENO, Nev. \u2013 Lucy Flores, a former member of the Nevada Legislature and 2014 candidate for lieutenant governor and U.S. Congress, has accused former Vice President Joe Biden of \"demeaning and disrespectful\" behavior for an alleged 2014 incident.\nThe allegation was made in a New York Magazine article published on Friday in which Flores recalls an unwanted kiss Biden allegedly gave her on the back of her head.\nA spokesperson for Biden said the Delaware politician does not remember the incident.\nThe accusation comes amid mounting rumors that Biden is considering a 2020 bid for the White House.\nHere's a look at who Lucy Flores is and her political career:\nMore:Joe Biden doesn\u2019t recall alleged kissing incident from 2014\nWho is Lucy Flores?\nFlores was raised in East Las Vegas, enduring a rocky childhood and dropping out of high school before passing the GED, earning her undergraduate degree at USC and her law degree from UNLV.\n\"When I started to have problems at home, however, there wasn\u2019t a support system for me,\" she wrote in an opinion piece for the Reno Gazette Journal in 2014. \"After my mom left when I was 9, my dad worked day and night to keep my family clothed and fed, leaving me with no one.

Ethan Miller/Getty Images, FILE\nFlores was the 35-year-old Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in Nevada when the alleged incident occurred at a campaign event on Nov. 1, 2014.\n\"As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. 'Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?'\u201d Flores wrote.\n\"I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, 'I didn\u2019t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual f---? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?'\u201d Flores' account continued.\n\"He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn\u2019t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused,\" she wrote. \"I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.\"\nFlores wrote that she had considered Biden to be attending the event in a professional capacity.\nNevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores presents a measure in committee at the Legislative Building in Carson City, Nev., May 10, 2013. Cathleen Allison/AP\n\"Biden came to Nevada to speak to my leadership and my potential to be second-in-command \u2014 an important role he knew firsthand. But he stopped treating me like a peer the moment he touched me. Even if his behavior wasn\u2019t violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful. I wasn\u2019t attending the rally as his mentee or even his friend; I was there as the most qualified person for the job.\"\nIn the interview, Flores called the exchange \"awkward and disturbing and weird.\"\nAlthough Biden has not definitively indicated whether he will run, his past actions are being scrutinized as that of a would-be candidate. Earlier this week, he drew ire from women's groups after he referenced his oft-criticized treatment of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court hearings in 1991. During the hearings, Hill was dismissed in her testimony about Thomas's alleged sexual harassment by members of the Senate. At the time, Biden was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nBiden has apologized frequently in public remarks to Hill, whose testimony has been seen in a new light since the #MeToo movement has grown.\nOn Tuesday, Biden renewed the conversation about his treatment of Hill when he spoke at the \u201cBiden Courage Awards\u201d to honor those who have worked to combat sexual assault on college campuses.\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the Biden Courage Awards in New York, March 26, 2019. Frank Franklin II/AP\n\"To this day, I regret I couldn\u2019t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved given the courage she showed by reaching out to us,\u201d Biden said at the event, which took place in New York.\nIn an interview with Elle magazine last September, Hill said, \"There are more important things to me now than hearing an apology from Joe Biden. I\u2019m okay with where I am.\"\nThe former vice president's remarks have renewed calls for an in-person apology to Hill. In January 2018 he was asked on PBS if he would apologize in person and he said that he hadn\u2019t planned on it.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "12339335497393537565", "docid": 0, "url": "https://ca.nba.com/news/nba-playoffs-2019-milwaukee-bucks-boston-celtics-giannis-antetokounmpo-kyrie-irving/8pxwhtbwbx921g42tpvoc03i1", "ms_text": "B___ t____ p_____ o__ t__ f____ r____ s____, l______ u_ t_ a r______ o_ l___ y___'s f____ r____ o_ t__ N__ P_______ w____ t__ C______ d_______ t__ B____ i_ s____ g____\nT__ f____ r____ i_ c_____ t_ a c____ a_ s___ t____ h___ a______ p______ t____ t_____ f__ t__ C_________ S_________.", "full_text": "The first round is coming to a close as some teams have already punched their ticket for the Conference Semifinals.\nNBA.com is your destination for complete coverage of every series from now through the end of the NBA Finals.\nSeries Schedule\nWhile some times have yet to be announced, here is the schedule for the series, which begins on April 28\nGame 1 - Sunday, April 28 at Milwaukee, 1:00 p.m.\nGame 2 - Tuesday, April 30 at Milwaukee, TBD\nGame 3 - Friday, May 3 at Boston, TBD\nGame 4 - Monday, May 6 at Boston, TBD\nGame 5 (if necessary) - Wednesday, May 8 at Milwaukee, TBD\nGame 6 (if necessary) - Friday, May 10 at Boston, TBD\nGame 7 (if necessary) - Monday, May 13 at Milwaukee, TBD\nRecapping the season series\nResult: Bucks won 2-1\nBest game: Feb. 21, 2019 \u2013 Bucks 98, Celtics 97\nBest performance: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Feb. 21, 2019) \u2013 30 points, 13 rebounds, 6 assists, 2 blocks, 1 steal\nTwo of the three games this season between the Bucks and Celtics came down to the final few possessions, but their most recent meeting in February takes the cake for the best showdown.\nIn the first primetime game following the All-Star break, the Celtics were looking to make a statement for the unofficial second half of the season by taking down the league's top team on their home court. The way these two teams battled, you could tell they were destined to see each other again at a point further down the line.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo was the most dominant player in the game per usual but it was Khris Middleton, the same player that did so much damage against Boston in the playoffs a season ago, who put the dagger in the Celtics' hearts in this one.\nAl Horford buried a 3-pointer to tie the game with just under a minute to go but on the next possession, Middleton dialled up from long range and got the clutch 3-pointer to fall giving his team a lead with 32 seconds remaining.\nKyrie Irving got a quick bucket and the Celtics were able to come up with a stop, giving them the final possession to try and win the game. Irving attacked the rim again but quality defence from Eric Bledsoe forced an off-balance off-handed floater that missed the mark, giving the Bucks the win and the season series.\nKey storyline: Can someone win on the road?\nThe first round series between the Bucks and Celtics was one of the best in the 2018 NBA Playoffs.\nWithout Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward, Boston gave Milwaukee all they could handle as young guns like Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum rose to the occasion.\nThe hitch in the series \u2013 neither team could win on the road.\nThe Celtics edged out Game 1 in overtime and took Game 2 with ease to protect home court. The Bucks handled Boston in Game 3 and led by as much as 19 points in the second half of Game 4 before the Celtics made an insane comeback. Nevertheless, Milwaukee got the win on a put-back from Antetokounmpo to even the series.\nBoston got Marcus Smart back for Game 5 at the TD Garden, giving his team and crowd the energy boost they needed to take a 3-2 lead. When the Bucks took Game 6 at home, it had become quite clear that the home teams were at a significant advantage.\nWhile anything can happen in Game 7, the Celtics closed out the battle of a series to advance to the next round.\nThis time around, it'll be Milwaukee who holds home court advantage. The Bucks had the second-best home record in the NBA this season at 33-8. They were also tied for the best road record in the league at 27-14, proving to an extent that they are capable of winning on the road, though playoffs are a completely different beast.\nAs for the Celtics, they were a solid 28-13 at home but were a mediocre 21-20 on the road \u2013 but again, the playoffs are a completely different beast.\nIf Boston is going to win this series they'll have to find a way to win on the road this time around. If Milwaukee wants to prove they're a serious contender for the NBA Championship, it'll require winning at the TD Garden, one of the loudest crowds the NBA has to offer.\nSomething has got to give.\n3 Players to Watch\nKhris Middleton\nvs. Boston in 2018-19 (three games): 17.3 points (36.5% FG, 40.0% 3PT), 8.7 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 1.3 steals\nMiddleton was the game-changer for the Bucks in the playoffs last year against the Celtics. The All-Star shooting guard had a breakout series, averaging 24.7 points per game on a ridiculous 59.8% from the field and 61.0% from long range.\nIt was arguably the best basketball we have seen from him in his six-year career and the Bucks will need more of the same in this series.\nBoston has done a significantly better job making things difficult for Middleton this regular season compared to last postseason but his scoring total is still right around his average for the season.\nAccording to NBA.com, the Celtics have used Marcus Smart as Middleton's primary defender on 49 possessions, the most on the team, and it's likely they'll be without Smart for at least the start of the series. That could mean Jayson Tatum becomes Middleton's matchup, and on the 44 possessions Tatum defended him in the regular season, Middleton was 1-for-7 from the field scoring just three points with one turnover.\nThe Bucks' sharpshooter has been solid in the postseason thus far but an uptick in scoring (averaging 19.0 points per game) wouldn't hurt against a Celtics team that is significantly better on offence than the Detroit Pistons.\nEric Bledsoe\nvs. Boston in 2018-19 (three games): 11.3 points (44.4% FG, 25.0% 3PT), 3.3 assists, 2.7 rebounds\nBledsoe was the opposite of Middleton in the playoffs last year, taking a step back from his performance throughout the regular season.\nHe was held to under 10 points in three of the seven games in the series, often being outplayed by Boston's fill-in starting point guard Terry Rozier. After some back-and-forth trash talk between the two guards, Bledsoe had stepped up his play in the slightest but the Bucks still needed more from him.\nThe Celtics did a good job of defending Bledsoe again this regular season, as all the numbers above are significantly worse than his averages for the year.\nLuckily for Milwaukee, Bledsoe has been one of their most consistent players so far this postseason as he's been stuffing the stat sheet posting 19.3 points, 5.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 2.0 steals per game.\nWith the uncertainty of Malcolm Brogdon's return Bledsoe's offence remains important, but where he'll be needed most is trying to disrupt the rhythm of superstar guard Kyrie Irving.\nGordon Hayward\nvs. Milwaukee in 2018-19 (two games): 14.5 points (37.5% FG, 36.4% 3PT), 3.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists\nHayward has been the X-factor for the Celtics this season and when he's playing well, the team usually wins.\nHe's finally hit his stride toward the back end of the season and looks more and more like the player the Celtics paid him to be each time he steps on the floor.\nIn fact, Boston is 7-0 this season in games that Hayward has scored 20 or more points. He was fantastic in Game 4 to close out the series against Indiana, scoring 20 points on nine shots, giving his team the boost they needed off the bench to advance to the next round.\nIt was a tale of two different performances against Milwaukee this season \u2013 in the game, Hayward played that the Celtics lost, he scored 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting. In the win, he had 18 points, five assists and four boards while knocking down three 3-pointers.\nAccording to NBA.com, Hayward has been defended by Middleton on 49 possessions this season. Of those 49 possessions, Hayward was 0-for-6 from the field.\nShould the Bucks take advantage of that matchup, Hayward will have to overcome those woes to make an impact.\nFast Facts\n\u2013 Kyrie Irving's playoff winning percentage of .768 is the highest of any player in NBA history (min. 50 games).\n\u2013 Following the Celtics' first-round sweep, Irving advanced to 16-0 in his career in the first round of the playoffs.\n\u2013 The Bucks domination of the Pistons was historical \u2013 their plus-95 point differential in a sweep was tied for the second most in NBA history.\n\u2013 The Bucks advanced out of the first round for the first time in seven consecutive postseason appearances. The last time Milwaukee advanced out of the first round, Giannis Antetokounmpo was six years old.\n\u2013 The Celtics are 20-14 all-time against the Bucks in the playoffs. In the six playoff series these teams have played against each other, Boston has won five of them.\n\u2013 This is the third time the Bucks and Celtics have met in the Conference Semifinals. Each team has won one Conference Semifinals series \u2013 the Bucks swept the Celtics in 1983 and the Celtics beat the Bucks in seven games in 1987.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "12813557002828865788", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/super-mario-maker-2-is-making-its-way-to-switch-this-june", "ms_text": "I____ 1 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 2 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 3 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 4 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 5 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 6 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 7 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 8 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 9 o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______ I____ 1_ o_ 1_ I____ c_____: N_______", "full_text": "Audio player loading\u2026\nThe original Mario Maker for Nintendo's under-appreciated Wii U console was one of the best games in the platforming plumber's entire legacy, allowing users to create and upload their own crazy levels (usually in an attempt to stump other players in the game's passionate online community). It was also followed shortly after by a Nintendo 3DS port.\nNow, Nintendo has announced a surprise sequel to its creativity-focused title with Super Mario Maker 2 set to arrive on Nintendo Switch this coming June.\nAnnounced at the top of the company's latest Nintendo Direct earlier today, Super Mario Maker 2 brings with it a host of new features and placeable objects, including the ability to add slopes to levels for some classic butt-sliding action.\nIt also appears that a new theme based on Super Mario 3D World has been added to the game, allowing users to place clear pipes and don a catsuit for wall-climbing, which should bring some fresh new approaches to level creation.\nWhile the original Mario Maker made use of the Wii U gamepad's second screen and stylus for swift item and platform placing, Super Mario Maker 2 will bring all of its tools to a single, primary screen with the implementation of new pop-up radial menus.\nIt's expected that Super Mario Maker 2 will employ similar touchscreen-based controls to its predecessor, though the game's first trailer doesn't explicitly show this \u2013 we'll surely find out more in the lead-up to its June 2019 release.\nCheck out some screenshots of the upcoming game below.\nImage 1 of 15 Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo Image credit: Nintendo", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "12813557002828865788", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/nintendo-announces-super-mario-maker-2-for-switch/", "ms_text": "S_________ b_ C___/N_______\nO__ o_ t__ W__ U's b______ h___ i_ a____ t_ m___ i__ w__ t_ t__ N_______ S_____ i_ t__ f___ o_ a_ e_______ s_____.", "full_text": "One of the Wii U's biggest hits is about to make its way to the Nintendo Switch in the form of an enhanced sequel. Nintendo announced Wednesday Super Mario Maker 2, launching on Nintendo Switch in June.\nIt's not the first hit game from the Wii U era to make its way to the company's hybrid portable console, but it's easily one of the most heavily anticipated. Super Mario Maker gave players the ability to create their own Super Mario Bros. levels in the style of the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World and the New Super Mario Bros. games. Mario Maker 2 seems to include all of that original content, plus a new mode for Super Mario 3D World.\nThat, it seems, is mostly just a new set of objects to place in the game, however, and not an isometric level building system that actually matches the style of the 3D world games. Still, the 3D World sets mean that Cat Mario and other 3D World exclusive power-ups will be making their way to the game.\nNintendo didn't give a firm release date for the game, but did promise a June 2019 launch.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "11561400794668598884", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-teases-geforce-rtx-2080-in-official-promo-video", "ms_text": "E____-e___ R_____ u____ s______ s______ h____ t_____ a_ N_____ G______ R__ 2___ i_ t__ 'B_ F__ T__ G___' v____ N_____ r_______ d_____ S_______.", "full_text": "Audio player loading\u2026\nApparently Nvidia revealed a little more than Turing and the first RTX graphics cards as the company dropped several easter eggs pointing to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in a promotional video.\nEagle-eyed Reddit users (opens in new tab) spotted several hints toward an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in the 'Be For The Game' video Nvidia released during Siggraph.

Monday, 8/13 @ 4:00 pm PT\nAs you can see, the event is solely focused at graphics designers, developers, and content creators so you can expect to see announcements related to those fields and not generally towards gamers as there\u2019s another event planned for them on 20th August at Gamescom 2018. This event may or may not introduce us to new graphics cards but if a launch was to take place, we\u2019d expect it to be either a Quadro based or a Titan based product.\nNVIDIA has previously announced and showcased their Titan and Quadro based graphics cards at previous SIGGRAPH events so we will most likely see a new one at this year\u2019s event too. We can also expect to see new software technologies introduced by NVIDIA along with more details on their upcoming RTX technology and the new Adaptive Temporal Anti-Aliasing method which was just recently announced. We will keep you posted with all the developments during the SIGGRAPH 2018 event.\nWhat do you think NVIDIA would announce during SIGGRAPH 2018?

Loads of people have turned up today. As so many people are trying to book tickets, we\u2019ve started a queue. Don\u2019t refresh this page as you may lose your place in the queue.\u2019\nAfter the tickets sold out, Ticketmaster directed fans to their resale site (Picture: GetMeIn)\nEven without the queue, tickets for the two dates \u2013 which cost between \u00a362.50 and \u00a3160 plus frees for general tickets and \u00a3220 for VIP \u2013 evaporated in under ten minutes.\nBut just minutes after the tickets were sold out, they began to pop up on Ticketmaster\u2019s official resale marketplace GetMeIn! for drastically elevated prices.\nCurrently on GetMeIn!, standing tickets for the 9 October date are being sold for \u00a31,170 per ticket.\nWhile a single upper tier ticket was being sold for \u00a3136, others in the same blocks are being flogged for \u00a31,039 and \u00a31,169.\nAnd less than an hour after the tickets went on sale on Ticketmaster, four lower tier seats with VIP passes are being sold for \u00a31,950.\nTickets are already being sold for upwards of \u00a31,00 (Picture: GetMeIn)\nUnsurprisingly, ARMYs are seriously frustrated with tickets being flogged for crazy prices after selling out so quickly \u2013 not least because the BTS priority ticket sale was cancelled earlier this week.\nBTS super-fan Angela Lee (@AngelaLeePR) told us: \u2018The tickets went on sale at 8.59am, if I wasn\u2019t already online then I wouldn\u2019t have even realised, and what makes it worse is that by the time it was 9.01am all the tickets were apparently sold out with tout sites marking these up to \u00a31,000+.\n\u2018What makes the situation even worse is that I\u2019ve been with O2 for over 10 years but then they decided to take off the priority sale at the eleventh hour.\u2019\nAnd fellow BTS devotee Jenny Carroll (@The.Jenny.Diaries) added: \u2018Being a BTS fan of course I sat at my desk at 8:00am, waiting for tickets to go on sale at 9:00am. To my surprise, but luckily I caught it, the queue opened up one minute early. While waiting in this queue, I noticed at 9:00am tickets were already on re-sale for \u00a31,000 in a back row sitting area.\n\u2018Two minutes later Ticketmaster let me know something went wrong with the queue and I had to start over. When I tried to re-enter, the website let me know that tickets were no longer available\u2026 AXS is still giving me hope because I am still in the queue\u2026 I hope my boss understands that I need to just go home and listen but also ask my parents to Hold Me Tight.\u2019\nJudging by social media, it seems that some ARMYs did get their hands on precious tickets to see the Fake Love stars perform \u2013 but we\u2019re holding out for a third date.\nMetro.co.uk has approached Ticketmaster for comment.\nGot a showbiz story?

But he has said this is his last time out on the road. Among his peers, Elton John and Kiss are also doing goodbye tours.\nMayor Bill de Blasio introduced Simon, calling him \u201cone of the greatest New York City artists of all time\u201d. The return to New York raised memories of two famous shows in Central Park, in 1981 with former partner Art Garfunkel and in 1991 on his own.\nSimon\u2019s only guest this time was his wife, Edie Brickell, who came out to whistle the solo in Me and Julio Down By the Schoolyard. But there were many references to familiar surroundings, like when he paused and beamed at an airplane descending over the park as he prepared to sing Homeward Bound.\n\u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d he said.\nWhen Simon finished singing Kodachrome, with its memorable line about \u201cthe crap I learned in high school\u201d, he said: \u201cTake that, Forest Hills High School.\u201d But, he conceded, he \u201cactually had a good time there\u201d.\nThe crowd cheered when Simon sang about the queen of Corona in Me & Julio Down By the Schoolyard.\n\u201cHow much fun is it to sing a song about Corona in Corona?\u201d he said.\nThe former high school baseball player brought out a glove and a ball, saying he wanted to play catch. He twice threw the ball into the audience and the return throws sailed over his head. On the third, Simon caught a perfect strike.\nHis 26-song set spanned more than 50 years. His band contained guitarists from Nigeria and South Africa and a classical sextet. The only references to Garfunkel were a couple of fleeting pictures during a nostalgic montage on the video screen. As Simon prepared to sing Bridge Over Troubled Water, he said: \u201cI\u2019m going to reclaim my lost child.\u201d He originally gave the giant hit to Garfunkel to sing.\nAn often dour performer, Simon has been animated and talkative during the final shows. He seems eager for the freedom that awaits him, said Robert Hilburn, who wrote the biography Paul Simon: A Life that was released this spring.\n\u201cThe thing that strikes me is that he\u2019s been happy, relieved,\u201d Hilburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a burden off of him.\u201d\nIn an earlier show in Portland, Oregon, Simon playfully \u201cpenalized\u201d himself for flubbing the lyrics to a song by singing an old Simon & Garfunkel hit he confessed to hating: \u201cThe 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin\u2019 Groovy).\u201d", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "15627203399633683429", "docid": 0, "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/little-boy-celebrates-birthday-alone-after-no-one-turned-up-party/", "ms_text": "N___ V______\nA s__-y___-o__ b__ w__ l___ a____ a__ d___________ a____ n_ o__ t_____ u_ t_ h__ f____-e___ b_______ b___.", "full_text": "A six-year-old boy was left alone and disappointed after no one turned up to his first-ever birthday bash.\nThis past Sunday, Sil Mazzini threw her son Teddy Bollinger a birthday party at Peter Piper Pizza restaurant in Tucson, Arizona, and she says, according to KVOA, she invited 32 of his classmates and their parents.\nWhile only two people said that they couldn\u2019t attend, the rest of the party-goers were no-shows, the birthday boy\u2019s mom said. \u201cI\u2019m done with parties for a while,\u201d Mazzini told ABC15 after her son\u2019s disappointing day.\nFor Teddy, whose real birthday was Oct. 3, a pizza party with his friends was all that he wanted for his 6th birthday.\nWhen Mazzini asked her six-year-old how he preferred to celebrate the occasion this year \u2014 with a trip to Legoland and a visit to Disneyland also in the running \u2014 she said Teddy was adamant about having a pizza party with his friends, KVOA said.\nThe party was supposed to be his first official big birthday bash.\nMazzini told the news outlet that she had handed out written invitations to her son\u2019s teacher two weeks before the party.

( AAP: Craig Golding )\nGWS has spanked a poor Essendon side by 72 points in their AFL clash, making it a wretched homecoming for a couple of former Giants.\nPlaying at the newly rebranded Giants Stadium on Sunday, GWS cruised to a 16.16 (112) to 5.10 (40) win in front of 15,424 fans, the largest non Sydney-derby regular season crowd at the venue.\nIt was a dark day for a Bombers side including former Giants Devon Smith and Dylan Shiel, who were booed by some of their old supporters, but that was the least of their problems.\nThe large contingent of Essendon supporters would have left disappointed by the lack of fight from their side following the optimistic pre-season expectations.\nJeremy Cameron kicked four goals, and Lachie Keefe and Stephen Coniglio three each, with the latter adding 31 possessions.\nKeefe, who limped off the ground in the first quarter after landing awkwardly following a marking contest, returned in the second term with a heavily strapped left knee and thigh and equalled his best goal haul from eight years ago.\nTim Taranto logged two goals and 31 touches for a GWS side that won the contested possessions count 157-118 and were far more consistent with their pressure and ball movement.\nThe Bombers lacked presence up forward without Joe Daniher and Cale Hooker and kicked just two goals in the first half and three in the second.\nGWS booted the first five goals to lead 35-4 early in the second quarter, before the Bombers landed successive majors to cut the gap to 20.\nThat was as close as they got, as GWS slammed on the next five goals either side of half-time to lead 73-19 .\nThe Giants piled on the first six goals of the final quarter to lead by as much as 85.\nShiel, Dyson Heppell and David Zaharakis all collected 25 disposals and Smith 24 for Essendon, who had two more inside 50s in the first quarter, but trailed by 16 after logging just four behinds.\nGiants youngster Harry Perryman didn't return for the second half after taking a couple of big knocks in the second quarter.\nSaints hold on for one-point win over Suns\nSt Kilda has rallied to record a one-point AFL victory over Gold Coast, holding off the Suns with a somewhat unconvincing performance.\nThe nailbiter was memorable for the mediocrity of both play and the pitch, with a late Jack Lonie behind proving the difference between the two sides.\nThe Saints held on for the four points... but only just.

Kyle Lowry (20 points, 12 assists) and Pascal Siakam (15 points, 15 rebounds) each put forth impressive double-doubles while the Sixers were led by 31 points and 11 rebounds from Joel Embiid. While Ben Simmons flirted with a triple-double (11 points, 10 assists, eight rebounds), he committed 11 turnovers on the night.\nThe next meeting between the teams would come over a month later, and the Sixers had added Jimmy Butler to an already-talented roster. Butler made his presence felt, scoring a game-high 38 points to go along with 10 rebounds but Kawhi Leonard was too much, as he finished with 36 points, nine rebounds, five steals and a block to lead Toronto to an 11-point win. The Raptors dominated on the inside in the second meeting as Serge Ibaka finished with 18 points and eight rebounds and Jonas Valanciunas scored 26 points and grabbed eight rebounds in a reserve role; Joel Embiid scored just 10 points (on 5-for-17 shooting) and grabbed 12 rebounds.\nThe Sixers lone win came in the third meeting of the year when the Raptors were without Kawhi Leonard. Joel Embiid (27 points), Ben Simmons (26 points) and J.J. Redick (22 points) combined to score 75 points as Philadelphia earned a convincing 126-101 win at Wells Fargo Center. The Raptors were led by 26 points from Pascal Siakam and 20 points (on 6-for-16 shooting) from a hobbled Kyle Lowry.\nIn the fourth and final meeting between the two teams this season, Kawhi Leonard scored a team-high 24 points despite shooting 3-for-11 from the field as the Raptors earned a 12-point win in Philadelphia. While he had a rough shooting night, Toronto's All-Star forward converted on 16 of his 17 free throw attempts in the game to make his presence felt on the offensive end. Both Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka added 20 points apiece while Pascal Siakam finished with 16 points in the win. In a losing effort, Joel Embiid scored a game-high 37 points to go along with 13 rebounds and three blocks while Ben Simmons finished with 20 points, seven rebounds, six assists and six turnovers.\nKey storyline: The Marc Gasol Effect\nBoth the Raptors and Sixers made a number of big moves during the regular season to bolster their respective rosters to better prepare for the postseason. Perhaps one of the biggest \u2013 quite literally \u2013 was Toronto's trade deadline move to acquire centre Marc Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies.\nGasol's passing ability has paid dividends for the Raptors, as evidenced by their increased efficiency on the offensive end. On the defensive end, Gasol has done an excellent job on interior scorers, most recently playing a large role in limiting Magic All-Star centre Nikola Vucevic to 11.2 points (on 36.2 FG%) in the first round.\nIt gets no easier this series, as Gasol will now be tasked with slowing down the Sixers All-NBA centre Joel Embiid, who averaged 24.8 points and 13.5 rebounds in their first-round series win over the Nets despite the fact he wasn't 100%.\nWhile Gasol was not yet a member of the Raptors roster for any of their four meetings with the Sixers this season, he has an impressive track record against Embiid in his career.\nThe two have met five times and Gasol has had a hand in holding Embiid to averages of 14.0 points (on 34.4 FG%), 12.4 rebounds to go along with 4.4 turnovers per game. The Gasol-led Grizzlies were 3-2 against Embiid and the Sixers.\nIn four games against the Raptors this season, Embiid averaged 26.3 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.8 blocks per game. His performance on the offensive end \u2013 and Gasol's ability to slow him down \u2013 could very well be what swings this series.\nThree Players to Watch\nKawhi Leonard\nvs. Philadelphia in 2018-19 (three games): 30.3 points (48.1 FG%, 50.0 3P%, 90.9 FT%), 7.7 rebounds, 4.0 steals, 2.7 assists\nLeonard made his presence felt in the three games in which he took the floor against Philadelphia this season. Starting with a 31-point performance early on in the year, Kawhi was the Raptors leading scorer each time they defeated the Sixers.\nPerhaps the most eye-popping stat from Leonard's three games against Philly this season derives from his ability to get to the line \u2013 Leonard averaged 11.0 free throw attempts through the three games, thanks in part to his going 16-for-17 from the line in a win in early Feb.\nAfter averaging 27.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.0 assists in the Raptors first-round series win over the Magic, playoff Kawhi is in full effect; he'll look to continue his stellar play in the second round.\nBen Simmons\nvs. Toronto in 2018-19 (four games): 16.3 points (62.8 FG%), 9.3 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 6.3 turnovers\nBen Simmons has an opportunity to reverse some recent misfortune that he's had against Leonard and the Sixers.\nWhile the Sixers 23-year-old All-Star put up impressive numbers on efficient shooting splits, he has a clear issue with turning the ball over against Toronto. To open the season, Simmons committed a career-high 11 turnovers as the Raptors defence stifled him throughout the night.\nTurnovers have been a season-long issue for the Sixers and it all begins with their point guard, who dictates the pace of the game with his unique blend of size, speed and playmaking ability. In Philly's three losses to Toronto, Simmons averaged 8.0 turnovers per game; he committed just one turnover in their win.\nKyle Lowry\nvs. Philadelphia in 2018-19 (four games): 16.8 points (40.7 FG%, 34.4 FG%), 6.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds, 1.8 steals\nThere's no question that Lowry, a proud native of North Philly, will be amped up for an opportunity to play postseason basketball in his hometown.\nDuring the regular season, Lowry appeared in all four games against the Sixers and scored exactly 20 points in all games except one. The All-Star guard's worst scoring performance against Philly came during his early December slump, as he finished with just seven points (on 2-for-8 shooting), four assists and three steals.\nLowry's grit and ability to score can give the Sixers problems on the defensive end and could also be just what the Raptors need to steal a game at Wells Fargo Center. In his most recent game in Philadelphia, Lowry scored 20 points while connecting on five of his nine 3-point attempts and dished out six assists.\nFast Facts\n- Philadelphia has advanced to the second round in consecutive years for the first time since doing so in 2000 and 2001.\n- Toronto has now advanced past the first round for four consecutive seasons.\n- This is the second postseason meeting between the Raptors and Sixers, and the first since the 2001 Eastern Conference Semifinals.

The Steam Database revealed that last week \u201cmysterious\u201d cards appeared on Steam in preparation for the start of the Steam summer sale 2018. There were ten of these mysterious Steam cards that emerged. For anyone wondering what\u2019s the significance of these Steam trading cards, then Fandom has the answer. As they helpfully explained in this post: \u201cMysterious cards are special cards that drop before a summer or winter sale. \u201cSince 2014, these cards have usually dropped about a week before the start of the sale.\u201d The post about the Steam cards added: \"These cards eventually changed into sales cards when the sale began.\" ORIGINAL - June 20 4pm BST: Steam users could soon be picking up some great money saving deals in the Steam summer sale 2018 which looks set to launch this week. Valve\u2019s market leading digital distribution service for PC gamers is expected to launch the Steam summer sale 2018 on Thursday.\nBridge Constructor Portal trailer on PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo\nThe launch dates for Steam sales are never revealed in advance by Valve, makers of classic titles such as Half Life 2 and Portal. However, there are a number of signs pointing towards the Steam summer sale 2018 kicking off on Thursday June 21, with a start time of 6pm in the UK. Last month the Steam Database tweeted that they knew the launch date for the Steam summer sale 2018. They tweeted: \u201cSteam Summer Sale starts on June 21st.\u201d\nSteam summer sale 2018 is expected to kick off on Thursday June 21 at 6pm BST\nAnd at the start of this week, as a reminder to their thousands of followers, Steam Database tweeted: \u201cThe #Steam Summer Sale starts this week on Thursday\u201d. While whenisthenextsteamsale.com is currently running a countdown till the start of the next Steam sale. Their countdown says the Steam summer sale 2018 will start at 6pm BST on Thursday. For other time zones, this is 1pm eastern time and 10am pacific time. Describing how they calculate when the next Steam sale will launch, the website said: \u201cValve never announces Steam sale dates up front, but Steam sales return every year in a relatively stable frequency. \u201cBased on data from the last few years, the upcoming sale dates are predicted.\nSteam Summer Sale will begin in 24 hours. https://t.co/qC1RvWCyjj pic.twitter.com/wfNv0n0P5F \u2014 Steam Database (@SteamDB) June 20, 2018\n\u201cThese predictions are a combination of the following factors: dates and months in which a sales started, which day of the week a sale usually starts. \"How long a sale usually lasts, what dates/events a sale generally hits, times are based on the East Pacific time zone. \u201cFurthermore the dates are updated every now and then when there is more information in recent news. \u201cAs you can see there are multiple sources to find out when a sale will most likely start.\u201d\nThe last Steam sale was the Steam Lunar New Year 2018 back in February. Before that it was the Steam Winter Sale, Steam Autumn sale, the Steam Halloween sale and the Steam Summer sale. Deals in the Steam Lunar New Year 2018 sale include money off the Witcher 3, Wolfenstein 2, Watch Dogs 2, Stardew Valley and Left 4 Dead 2.\nThe Steam summer sale for 2017 began at a similar time to the predicted 2018 launch date", "sid": 1, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "16407445061174650283", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.pcgamer.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2018-has-begun/?&_flexi_variantId=sticky-header-a", "ms_text": "T__ p_______ f_______ i_ n__ f________: T__ S____ S_____ S___ i_ l___!", "full_text": "Seeking the dates for your next Steam Sale savings?

Luckily, Valve's grown into a more forthcoming attitude with their sale calendar: the dates are revealed well in advance\u2014usually, anyway\u2014and the seasonal sales serve as predictable quarterly landmarks. Still, with Steam now rolling out frequent genre-specific sales, it can be helpful to have someone doing the calendar-keeping for you. Good news: we've got your back. We're tracking all the confirmed Steam Sale dates as they're announced, so you can focus on keeping your wishlist up-to-date.\nThe seasonal sales during Summer, Autumn, Winter generally offer the widest and deepest selection of discounts, and a Spring sale will take the place of the Lunar New Year sale to fill out the seasonal rotation. Between seasonal sales, there are genre-specific \"Fests\" offering discounts on specific game categories.\nWhether you're looking for dates for the next genre-themed sale, or marking your calendar for the tentpole seasonal sales, here's your handbook for the best times to expand your Steam library without emptying your wallet.\nWhen is the next Steam sale? The next major seasonal sale is the Steam Spring Sale, running from March 16 - March 23, 2023. A new replacement for the Lunar New Year sale, we're hoping the Spring Sale has similar discounts to the other quarterly sale events. Before then, we'll have genre-specific Fests for base-builders at the end of January, followed by mystery games in February. Here are all the upcoming Steam sale dates we know so far:\nJan 23 - Jan 30, 2023: Base Builder Fest\nFeb 20 - Feb 27, 2023: Mystery Fest\nMar 16 - Mar 23, 2023: Steam Spring Sale\nApr 24 - May 1, 2023: Puzzle Fest\nMay 15 - May 22, 2023: Sports Fest\nJun 29 - Jul 13, 2023: Steam Summer Sale\nJul 24 - Jul 31, 2023: Stealth Fest\nAug 7 - Aug 14, 2023: Visual Novel Fest\nAug 28 - Sep 4, 2023: Strategy Fest\nSep 25 - Oct 2, 2023: SHMUP Fest\nOct 26 - Nov 2, 2023: Scream Fest (Halloween)\nNov 21 - Nov 28, 2023: Steam Autumn Sale\nDec 21, 2023 - Jan 4, 2024: Steam Winter Sale\nHow long do Steam sales last?\nThe Summer and Winter sales are the big ones. They tend to last two weeks (ish). The smaller Spring and Autumn sales, along with the genre Fests, all last about a week.\nWhat times of the year does Steam have sales?\nSteam now has sales nearly every month of the year, but the seasonal sales most folks look forward to are the Summer Sale and Winter Sale and to a lesser extent the Halloween Sale and Black Friday (Autumn) Sale.\nAs for which Steam sale is biggest, we tend to see the steepest discounts in the Summer and Winter sales, with the Summer sales offering the choicest selection. With Autumn and Winter sales following so close on the heels of Fall release season, there tend to be fewer big, recent titles with hefty discounts. By the following summer you can get great discounts on relatively new games. (Here's how long it usually takes for games to get cheap on Steam.)\nIn the past, when we've rounded up the best Steam deals ever (opens in new tab), we've seen some remarkable discounts. Valve's Portal 2 went from $50 to $5 in the Summer Sale a year after release.\nDon't entirely ignore the smaller, genre-themed sales throughout the year, though. They might not offer as deep discounts on as wide a selection as the seasonal sales, but they're still worth a look if you've been craving the kind of gameplay being highlighted and can't wait until the next headliner sale.\n(Image credit: Valve)\nWhen is the next Steam Next Fest?\nThe next Steam Next Fest starts on June 19, and runs from June 19 - 26, 2023. These festivals usually happen close to Steam's bigger yearly sales and Valve has said that there is a Next Fest also planned for October of 2023.\nSteam Festivals (now called Next Fest) aren't sales, exactly, but they're another way to play games for cheap. Since 2020, Steam has been running regular festival weeks where hundreds of upcoming games offer free demos for you to play. It can be a daunting list to sort through, like sales are, but it's a great way to try something you've had your eye on.\nSteam sale tips\nUse your wishlist\nWhenever you see a game you might want, add it to your wishlist. You will receive notifications when wishlisted games are on sale and having a list makes it easier to resist buying unlisted games for the sake of it on impulse. If a game is not on your list, do you really want it?\nLooking for a way to quickly fill up your wishlist? Check out our round up of the top 100 games (opens in new tab) you can play on PC today. Here are 100 other smaller games (opens in new tab) judged by algorithm to be the best hidden gems on Steam. And these are the best PC games we recommend right now.\nKeep an eye on publisher bundles\nPublisher bundles can knock lots of money off entire series or catalogues. If you want to buy an individual Hitman game then you might want to check for a series bundle\u2014chances are you could get all of the games for not much more.\nSnap up expansions and DLC\nExpansions can often feel a little overpriced, especially if they're only adding a few hours of new stuff to your game. In Steam sales you can pick up a lot of DLC for just a few bucks and reinvigorate games in your back catalogue.\nStock up on indie treats\nYou can get big percentage discounts on big budget games in the major Steam Sales, but even with a hefty trim those games can still cost 20 or 30 bucks. If you want to maximise the amount of play time you get out of a Steam sale, quality indie games go down to dollars, and even cents. If you need more storage to hold them all, these are the best SSDs for gaming right now.\nYou can always wait for another sale\nIf you're not going to play a game before the next big Steam sale rolls around, you might as well wait. Chances are the discounts will increase as the annual sales roll by, all while you're clearing your backlog.\nIt's also much easier to wait on a purchase these days because there are no daily or flash deals. If you see a discount, you know that's going to be stable until the end of the sale so you can wait a few days to make a decision. Maybe that'll give you time to upgrade to one of the best gaming PCs, or pick out a new graphics card if you need to upgrade.\nCheck on weekends for publisher or themed sales\nIt's not uncommon for a publisher to showcase all of its products on sale during a weekend, an event which is usually marked by a homepage takeover of sorts. Look out for these if you're after a blockbuster game at a better price.\nConsider Steam resellers if you don't want to wait for a sale\nCheck out our guide on where to buy PC games (opens in new tab), if you want more places to shop around.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "16407445061174650283", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.pcgamer.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2018-has-begun/?&_flexi_variantId=sticky-header-a", "ms_text": "T___ m____ c____ t_ c______, a b____ t_ e___, a g___ t_ p___, a__ y__, s___ d____ o_ g____.", "full_text": "Seeking the dates for your next Steam Sale savings?

If you want to maximise the amount of play time you get out of a Steam sale, quality indie games go down to dollars, and even cents. If you need more storage to hold them all, these are the best SSDs for gaming right now.\nYou can always wait for another sale\nIf you're not going to play a game before the next big Steam sale rolls around, you might as well wait. Chances are the discounts will increase as the annual sales roll by, all while you're clearing your backlog.\nIt's also much easier to wait on a purchase these days because there are no daily or flash deals. If you see a discount, you know that's going to be stable until the end of the sale so you can wait a few days to make a decision. Maybe that'll give you time to upgrade to one of the best gaming PCs, or pick out a new graphics card if you need to upgrade.\nCheck on weekends for publisher or themed sales\nIt's not uncommon for a publisher to showcase all of its products on sale during a weekend, an event which is usually marked by a homepage takeover of sorts.

It's never too early to plan out your penny-saving schedule. Luckily, Valve's grown into a more forthcoming attitude with their sale calendar: the dates are revealed well in advance\u2014usually, anyway\u2014and the seasonal sales serve as predictable quarterly landmarks. Still, with Steam now rolling out frequent genre-specific sales, it can be helpful to have someone doing the calendar-keeping for you. Good news: we've got your back. We're tracking all the confirmed Steam Sale dates as they're announced, so you can focus on keeping your wishlist up-to-date.\nThe seasonal sales during Summer, Autumn, Winter generally offer the widest and deepest selection of discounts, and a Spring sale will take the place of the Lunar New Year sale to fill out the seasonal rotation. Between seasonal sales, there are genre-specific \"Fests\" offering discounts on specific game categories.\nWhether you're looking for dates for the next genre-themed sale, or marking your calendar for the tentpole seasonal sales, here's your handbook for the best times to expand your Steam library without emptying your wallet.\nWhen is the next Steam sale? The next major seasonal sale is the Steam Spring Sale, running from March 16 - March 23, 2023. A new replacement for the Lunar New Year sale, we're hoping the Spring Sale has similar discounts to the other quarterly sale events. Before then, we'll have genre-specific Fests for base-builders at the end of January, followed by mystery games in February. Here are all the upcoming Steam sale dates we know so far:\nJan 23 - Jan 30, 2023: Base Builder Fest\nFeb 20 - Feb 27, 2023: Mystery Fest\nMar 16 - Mar 23, 2023: Steam Spring Sale\nApr 24 - May 1, 2023: Puzzle Fest\nMay 15 - May 22, 2023: Sports Fest\nJun 29 - Jul 13, 2023: Steam Summer Sale\nJul 24 - Jul 31, 2023: Stealth Fest\nAug 7 - Aug 14, 2023: Visual Novel Fest\nAug 28 - Sep 4, 2023: Strategy Fest\nSep 25 - Oct 2, 2023: SHMUP Fest\nOct 26 - Nov 2, 2023: Scream Fest (Halloween)\nNov 21 - Nov 28, 2023: Steam Autumn Sale\nDec 21, 2023 - Jan 4, 2024: Steam Winter Sale\nHow long do Steam sales last?\nThe Summer and Winter sales are the big ones. They tend to last two weeks (ish). The smaller Spring and Autumn sales, along with the genre Fests, all last about a week.\nWhat times of the year does Steam have sales?\nSteam now has sales nearly every month of the year, but the seasonal sales most folks look forward to are the Summer Sale and Winter Sale and to a lesser extent the Halloween Sale and Black Friday (Autumn) Sale.\nAs for which Steam sale is biggest, we tend to see the steepest discounts in the Summer and Winter sales, with the Summer sales offering the choicest selection. With Autumn and Winter sales following so close on the heels of Fall release season, there tend to be fewer big, recent titles with hefty discounts. By the following summer you can get great discounts on relatively new games. (Here's how long it usually takes for games to get cheap on Steam.)\nIn the past, when we've rounded up the best Steam deals ever (opens in new tab), we've seen some remarkable discounts. Valve's Portal 2 went from $50 to $5 in the Summer Sale a year after release.\nDon't entirely ignore the smaller, genre-themed sales throughout the year, though. They might not offer as deep discounts on as wide a selection as the seasonal sales, but they're still worth a look if you've been craving the kind of gameplay being highlighted and can't wait until the next headliner sale.\n(Image credit: Valve)\nWhen is the next Steam Next Fest?\nThe next Steam Next Fest starts on June 19, and runs from June 19 - 26, 2023. These festivals usually happen close to Steam's bigger yearly sales and Valve has said that there is a Next Fest also planned for October of 2023.\nSteam Festivals (now called Next Fest) aren't sales, exactly, but they're another way to play games for cheap. Since 2020, Steam has been running regular festival weeks where hundreds of upcoming games offer free demos for you to play. It can be a daunting list to sort through, like sales are, but it's a great way to try something you've had your eye on.\nSteam sale tips\nUse your wishlist\nWhenever you see a game you might want, add it to your wishlist.

It's never too early to plan out your penny-saving schedule. Luckily, Valve's grown into a more forthcoming attitude with their sale calendar: the dates are revealed well in advance\u2014usually, anyway\u2014and the seasonal sales serve as predictable quarterly landmarks. Still, with Steam now rolling out frequent genre-specific sales, it can be helpful to have someone doing the calendar-keeping for you. Good news: we've got your back. We're tracking all the confirmed Steam Sale dates as they're announced, so you can focus on keeping your wishlist up-to-date.\nThe seasonal sales during Summer, Autumn, Winter generally offer the widest and deepest selection of discounts, and a Spring sale will take the place of the Lunar New Year sale to fill out the seasonal rotation. Between seasonal sales, there are genre-specific \"Fests\" offering discounts on specific game categories.\nWhether you're looking for dates for the next genre-themed sale, or marking your calendar for the tentpole seasonal sales, here's your handbook for the best times to expand your Steam library without emptying your wallet.\nWhen is the next Steam sale? The next major seasonal sale is the Steam Spring Sale, running from March 16 - March 23, 2023. A new replacement for the Lunar New Year sale, we're hoping the Spring Sale has similar discounts to the other quarterly sale events. Before then, we'll have genre-specific Fests for base-builders at the end of January, followed by mystery games in February. Here are all the upcoming Steam sale dates we know so far:\nJan 23 - Jan 30, 2023: Base Builder Fest\nFeb 20 - Feb 27, 2023: Mystery Fest\nMar 16 - Mar 23, 2023: Steam Spring Sale\nApr 24 - May 1, 2023: Puzzle Fest\nMay 15 - May 22, 2023: Sports Fest\nJun 29 - Jul 13, 2023: Steam Summer Sale\nJul 24 - Jul 31, 2023: Stealth Fest\nAug 7 - Aug 14, 2023: Visual Novel Fest\nAug 28 - Sep 4, 2023: Strategy Fest\nSep 25 - Oct 2, 2023: SHMUP Fest\nOct 26 - Nov 2, 2023: Scream Fest (Halloween)\nNov 21 - Nov 28, 2023: Steam Autumn Sale\nDec 21, 2023 - Jan 4, 2024: Steam Winter Sale\nHow long do Steam sales last?\nThe Summer and Winter sales are the big ones. They tend to last two weeks (ish). The smaller Spring and Autumn sales, along with the genre Fests, all last about a week.\nWhat times of the year does Steam have sales?\nSteam now has sales nearly every month of the year, but the seasonal sales most folks look forward to are the Summer Sale and Winter Sale and to a lesser extent the Halloween Sale and Black Friday (Autumn) Sale.\nAs for which Steam sale is biggest, we tend to see the steepest discounts in the Summer and Winter sales, with the Summer sales offering the choicest selection. With Autumn and Winter sales following so close on the heels of Fall release season, there tend to be fewer big, recent titles with hefty discounts. By the following summer you can get great discounts on relatively new games. (Here's how long it usually takes for games to get cheap on Steam.)\nIn the past, when we've rounded up the best Steam deals ever (opens in new tab), we've seen some remarkable discounts. Valve's Portal 2 went from $50 to $5 in the Summer Sale a year after release.\nDon't entirely ignore the smaller, genre-themed sales throughout the year, though. They might not offer as deep discounts on as wide a selection as the seasonal sales, but they're still worth a look if you've been craving the kind of gameplay being highlighted and can't wait until the next headliner sale.\n(Image credit: Valve)\nWhen is the next Steam Next Fest?\nThe next Steam Next Fest starts on June 19, and runs from June 19 - 26, 2023. These festivals usually happen close to Steam's bigger yearly sales and Valve has said that there is a Next Fest also planned for October of 2023.\nSteam Festivals (now called Next Fest) aren't sales, exactly, but they're another way to play games for cheap. Since 2020, Steam has been running regular festival weeks where hundreds of upcoming games offer free demos for you to play. It can be a daunting list to sort through, like sales are, but it's a great way to try something you've had your eye on.\nSteam sale tips\nUse your wishlist\nWhenever you see a game you might want, add it to your wishlist. You will receive notifications when wishlisted games are on sale and having a list makes it easier to resist buying unlisted games for the sake of it on impulse. If a game is not on your list, do you really want it?\nLooking for a way to quickly fill up your wishlist? Check out our round up of the top 100 games (opens in new tab) you can play on PC today. Here are 100 other smaller games (opens in new tab) judged by algorithm to be the best hidden gems on Steam. And these are the best PC games we recommend right now.\nKeep an eye on publisher bundles\nPublisher bundles can knock lots of money off entire series or catalogues. If you want to buy an individual Hitman game then you might want to check for a series bundle\u2014chances are you could get all of the games for not much more.\nSnap up expansions and DLC\nExpansions can often feel a little overpriced, especially if they're only adding a few hours of new stuff to your game. In Steam sales you can pick up a lot of DLC for just a few bucks and reinvigorate games in your back catalogue.\nStock up on indie treats\nYou can get big percentage discounts on big budget games in the major Steam Sales, but even with a hefty trim those games can still cost 20 or 30 bucks. If you want to maximise the amount of play time you get out of a Steam sale, quality indie games go down to dollars, and even cents. If you need more storage to hold them all, these are the best SSDs for gaming right now.\nYou can always wait for another sale\nIf you're not going to play a game before the next big Steam sale rolls around, you might as well wait. Chances are the discounts will increase as the annual sales roll by, all while you're clearing your backlog.\nIt's also much easier to wait on a purchase these days because there are no daily or flash deals.

Now, the Swedish automaker is taking a big initiative to combat speeding, and announced Monday that it will soon limit the top speed of all its cars to 112 miles per hour.\nThe company wants to send \"a strong signal about the dangers of speeding,\" according to an official statement, and says this speed-limiting change will go into effect in 2020, on 2021 model year vehicles.\n\"While a speed limitation is not a cure-all, it's worth doing if we can even save one life,\" Volvo Car Group president H\u00e5kan Samuelsson said in a statement.\nIt's unclear if this 112-mph speed limit will apply to just Volvos, or if Polestar cars will be affected as well. Volvo also did not specifically state if this change will only affect the US, or if other global markets will have speed-limited cars, too. This could be a deal-breaker for folks in, say, Germany, a country known for its many unrestricted sections of Autobahn. The company also did not specify if customers will be able to spec a speed delimiter upon request. A Volvo spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThis move comes as part of the company's \"Vision 2020\" safety initiative, which \"aims for no one to be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo by 2020.\" The Swedish automaker says it has identified speeding as one of several driver behaviors that it intends to reduce.\n\"We want to start a conversation about whether carmakers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver's behavior,\" Samuelsson said. To that end, the company is also investigating whether or not it should implement \"smart speed control\" and geofencing technologies, which could automatically restrict a vehicle's speed in dense pedestrian areas, or near places like schools and hospitals.\nVolvo notes that, above certain speeds, in-car safety tech is not enough to prevent severe injuries or fatalities in the event of a collision. The company points out that 25 percent of all traffic fatalities in the US in 2017 were caused by speeding, citing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data.\nOf course, here in the US, a 112-mph top end won't technically matter to most folks. A Texas highway currently has the highest posted speed limit in the country, at 85 mph, and there are no unrestricted sections of public roadway.\nIn addition to speeding, Volvo is looking at things like driver distraction and intoxication as problem areas in its quest to make all roadways safer. The company says it will soon offer ideas on how to combat these issues, as well.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "5531111364713165497", "docid": 0, "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/412826-cruz-jokes-about-locking-up-beto-orourke-in-double-occupancy-cell-with", "ms_text": "T____ S__.

It should never have been on the road to begin with.\"\nWhat about the intersection?\nThat's another issue under review.\nThe accident occurred at the bottom of steep hill at the intersection of Route 30A and Route 30 next to a country store -- where two bystanders were among the 20 killed.\nNeighbors said the grade of the road has been problematic, and a decade ago the state changed it from a Y-shaped intersection to a T-shaped intersection.\nIn all, the state DOT said four accident have occurred there over the past decade.\nBut the safety of the intersection is part of the investigation, authorities said.\nSchoharie Town Supervisor Alan Tavenner said days after the crash, \"There were problems with tractor-trailers losing their brakes on that hill.\u201d\nIn fact, tractor trailers were banned from Route 30 years ago.\nWhy wasn't the limo impounded?\nOn Aug. 25, State Police said a trooper stopped the limo in Saratoga Springs and issued violations to the company and to Lisinicchia that he was operating the limo without the proper license.\n\"The Trooper also took steps to ensure that the vehicle was taken off the road, returned to its original location and directed the driver not to drive the vehicle,\" State Police said.\nThen a month later, the limo failed an inspection by the state Department of Motor Vehicles.\nBut while the limo was affixed with a sticker that it couldn't operate, the state didn't impound it -- and then it ended up back on the road.\nIn the case of the police stop in August, \"The Trooper did not have the legal authority to seize the plates or the vehicle during that stop,\" State Police said.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said it wasn't about the state's actions. It was the company that continued to operate a limo that was repeatedly deemed unsafe by the state.\n\"So sometimes you say, \u2018Well, maybe we should inspect more frequently. Maybe this, maybe this,\" he told reporters Oct. 8.\n\"Sometimes people just don\u2019t follow the law, and that maybe what happened here.\"\nWill the owner of the limousine company be charged?\nThe owner of Prestige Limousine, Shahed Hussain, has not yet been charged with a crime.\nHis whereabouts could be a complicating factor: Shahed Hussain is currently in Pakistan. He was there before the crash, according to Kindlon.\nBeach, the police superintendent, said Wednesday that he does not have the authority to compel Shahed Hussain to come back to the U.S.\n\"My understanding that the father remains out of country at this time but that will remain part of the investigation as well,\" Beach said.\nKindlon said Shahed Hussain will cooperate with the investigation and return if necessary.\nNauman Hussain, Shahed's son, acted as the operator of the limousine company, according to State Police. He was arrested and released on $150,000 bond Thursday.\n\"The sole responsibility for that motor vehicle being on the road on Saturday rests with Nauman Hussain,\" Beach said.\nMore:Live From Albany: The latest on the deadly limousine crash and what happens next\nMore:Suspicious death investigated at hotel owned by limo service owner\nWill Nauman Hussain face more charges?\nNauman Hussain is currently facing a single count of criminally negligent homicide, a Class E felony that is punishable by up to four years in prison.\nAll 20 victims were listed by State Police within the single count.\nThe charge accuses Nauman Hussain of having \"grossly deviated from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe\" because he knew (or should have known) Lisinicchia wasn't properly licensed and that the limo was in disrepair.\nIt's possible it could be split into separate charges for each victim at a later date, which would mean he could face significantly more jail time.\n\"Any changes to that will be done with the consent and on the direction of the Schoharie County district attorney,\" Beach said.\nBeach said Nauman Hussain received written notification that Lisinicchia didn't have the proper license when the driver was pulled over weeks prior to the accident.\nMore:What we know about the 20 victims of the Schoharie limo crash\nMore:Troopers arrest operator of limo company after deadly crash\nWho will be liable?\nThe question of who will be held liable for the crash will ultimately determine who will compensate the victims\u2019 family for their loss.\nIn civil court, liability can be split among several parties.\nWill the limousine company be liable for allowing the vehicle on the road despite it failing inspection and the driver not having the right license allowances?\nWill the state be liable for the safety of the intersection, which is at the bottom of a large hill and has long been cited by residents as troublesome?\nWhat about the driver\u2019s estate?\nThose are all questions that will likely be answered in civil court. The victims\u2019 families have 90 days from the time of the accident to file what\u2019s known as a \u201cnotice of claim\u201d against the state.\n\u201cCould there be some fault with Prestige? Could there be some fault here? Absolutely,\u201d said Lee Kindlon, attorney for the Hussain family.\n\u201cIs it criminal? Absolutely not. What about the state of New York?\u201d\nMore:Limo crash vigil honors first responders\nMore:Thousands mourn 20 killed in limo crash\nWhat was happening that day?\nSeventeen friends, many married or related and from Amsterdam, were heading to Ommegang, a craft brewery in Cooperstown, to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday.\nIt was the birthday for Amy Steenburg, a newlywed and the youngest of the four sisters in the limousine.\nThey were all killed along her husband and brother in law.\nThe trip also leaves some unanswered questions.\nIt's about a one-hour car trip between Amsterdam and Cooperstown, but it's unclear why the limo was in Schoharie -- which would seem to be out of the way.\nPolice haven't clarified the limo's route.\n\u201cI have had some basic (conversations), how was he getting from A to B, the routes and all those things,\" Kindlon said.\n\"Some of those questions we can\u2019t answer, unfortunately.\u201d\nWill it lead to change?\nProbably so. About 20 states do require back-seat passengers in limos to wear seat belts.\nNew York is not one of them. New York only requires the front-seat passenger and driver to wear seat belts.\nAlso, it could promote new regulations on how limos are overseen.\nNot only did the limo not have a state inspection, it appeared to lack a federal certificate for an SUV that was converted to a stretch limousine, Cuomo said.\n\"We got to let the NTSB do their job. We need to let the State Police do their job,\" Assemblyman Christopher Tague, R- Schoharie, told reporters at the scene last Monday.\n\"And then we'll take the information that they give us, and we will bring legislation after we get the reports back from all the investigators.\"", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "17219739586174786853", "docid": 1, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/combined-funeral-held-8-killed-ny-limo-crash-170203308.html", "ms_text": "A u____ u__ w___ c_______ a____ o_ A___ J______ a__ A______ J______ i_ s__ i_ p____ a_ f______ a__ f_____ p______ f__ a f______ m___ a_ S_.

But he never got to hear the good news.\nThat\u2019s because when his acceptance email arrived in 2014, Abramovitz\u2019s then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lee, deleted it and sent him a fake rejection email from the school. It was a $265,000 mistake.\n\u201cIt was really devastating to feel that incredible betrayal,\u201d Abramovitz told CNN. \u201cIt made me think of our whole relationship and it made me feel like everything might have been a lie.\u201d\nWhere it began\nA college sophomore studying music at McGill University at the time, Abramovitz had applied to a two-year, full-scholarship program to finish his bachelor\u2019s degree at Colburn Conservatory of Music in Los Angeles. Itching to study with a renowned clarinet teacher, Abramovitz spent many late nights in practice rooms to prepare for his audition, which he thought went well.\nThe full scholarship \u2013 which includes tuition, room and board \u2013 is worth about $50,000 a year and Abramovitz said graduating from Colburn would have set him up for a high-paying symphony career. When he was rejected, Abramovitz said he was crushed.\n\u201cIt was a disappointing feeling,\u201d Abramovitz said. \u201cI had such high hopes.\u201d\nAbramovitz would have studied under Yehuda Gilad, who is considered one of the best clarinet instructors in the world, he said.

His first period at the Midlands club lasted from 1968 until 1975 \u2013 four years later, he also resigned from the board. Once he left, Villa enjoyed one of its greatest periods of success, winning the First Division championship in 1981 and the European Cup in 1982.\nWhether by coincidence or not, when Ellis returned as chairman shortly afterwards, the club swiftly fell back from its great heights, to the point where the team was relegated to the Second Division in 1986-87. After a stock market flotation that made Ellis millions of pounds, he eventually sold up in 2006 to Randy Lerner, an American billionaire, but remained at the club as a life president.\nEllis divided opinion among the fans, who were wont to blame him over the years for failing to invest more in new players. His relations with the club\u2019s managers were also famously embroiled, most of all with Ron Saunders, who was at Villa from 1974 until 1982. He sacked several managers in his time (although Saunders was not one of them) and others resigned after disagreements.\nFrom the start, Ellis\u2019s relationship with the club and its fans had been based on an element of suspicion, as he had arrived there directly from Villa\u2019s closest rival, Birmingham City, where he was a director. When challenged by Villa fans about his affinities, his clever reply was that his spell at Birmingham had been a perfect introduction to the game, showing him how a club ought not to be run.\nDoug was born and grew up in Hooton, Cheshire, and experienced hardship from an early age. When he was three his father, Herbert, died, leaving his young widow, Jane, to bring up Doug and his eight-week-old sister, Doreen. As a boy, Doug delivered milk to local customers by bike before setting off for school in Chester, and later also worked as a railway clerk.\nDuring second world war service with the Fleet Air Arm, he was based in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he conceived the idea that eventually made him rich. Revelling in his tropical surroundings, Ellis began to wonder how young working men such as himself, who had never been away from home, could be provided with the chance to enjoy the delights of exotic places.\nDoug Ellis looks on as Pat Matthews, the club president, pours champagne to celebrate Aston Villa\u2019s victory over Manchester United in the League Cup Semi-Final 2nd Leg at Villa Park, 1970. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images\nThis led to his notion of founding a travel agency and, after learning the business with Frames Tours in Preston, he set up his own agency in Birmingham in 1948, and then one of the first package tour businesses, Ellis Travel Agency. Costs were cut to the bone; sandwiches for the passengers were made by Ellis\u2019s mother. The business prospered, Ellis became a millionaire, and then he set his sights on becoming a football club director.\nIn the 1960s, Ellis had season tickets for Aston Villa and Birmingham City, but Villa, a historically great club, rebuffed his interest in them. He was granted a meeting with the Villa directors, but they kept him waiting in a dim corridor, where he amused himself by writing his name on the grubby windows. When he finally got his audience, he was told that he had been refused. The word was that they considered him too brash an individual to accept.\nUndeterred, Ellis pursued his second choice and became instead a director of Birmingham City, biding his time until at last, in 1968, he was allowed in at Villa.That year marked the beginning of a revolution at Villa Park, in which the senatorial board was swept away by a bunch of younger men, most of them, like Ellis, in their 40s. At the time the club was struggling deep in the Second Division and in financial difficulties.\nUnder Ellis\u2019s aegis, the flamboyant Scot Tommy Docherty was made manager and attendances soared. Although the club was relegated to Division Three in 1969-70, it quickly gained promotion and in 1975 not only returned at last to the First Division but won the League Cup \u2013 one of four times the club won that competition under Ellis. In fact the League Cup would be the only significant honour that Villa achieved during his two terms, although they were runners-up in the top flight in 1989-90 and then in 1992-93.\nDoug Ellis, who made his millions in package holidays, parks his Rolls-Royce outside Villa Park, Aston Villa\u2019s ground, in Birmingham, in 1969. Photograph: Getty Images\nAmong the big-name managers Ellis appointed and then saw off were Graham Taylor (twice), David O\u2019Leary, Ron Atkinson and John Gregory. Gregory reported that his boss \u201ccontrols the football club from top to bottom and has the final say on everything\u201d. His great strength, Gregory said, \u201cis looking after the pennies, [which] takes up a large proportion of his working day\u201d.\nIn spite of the parsimony, Ellis often felt able to spend large sums of money in other directions. He became the first football director to give himself a salary once Football Association rules were relaxed to allow such payments. As the majority shareholder, he also received huge sums in dividends over the years, and even more from the flotation of the club on the stock market in 1997.\nIn 2004, at the age of 80 and suffering from prostate cancer, Ellis agreed to relinquish some of his control of the club. He had a heart bypass operation the following year and, in 2006, he announced that he had agreed to sell the club to Lerner for around \u00a363m. Ellis stood aside when the takeover was completed, but stayed in touch as president emeritus.\nHe was appointed OBE in 2005 and knighted in 2012 for his charitable work.\nEllis\u2019s first marriage, in 1946, to Audrey Slater, a nurse who cared for him when he contracted malaria in Sri Lanka, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Heidi (nee Kroeger), whom he married in 1963, and their two sons, Oliver and Simon.

Additionally, Forbes reports Japanese fast-fashion company Uniqlo made an offer, which Osaka declined.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\nMonday morning brought a heavy dousing of cold water to a story that had got Manchester United fans hot under the collar, though it feels like a tale that has some distance left to run.\nFrom the frying pan of the Glazer family's controversial ownership into the potential fire being taken over by Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a buyout of the world's biggest football club would have been monumental not just in sporting terms but also as a landmark geopolitical story that would almost certainly have spawned protests way beyond the green and gold scarves of the early Glazer years.\nBy way of a brief recap, Saudi media minister Turki Al-Shabanah put distance between the kingdom and speculation surrounding a takeover of the Old Trafford club with a few choice tweets in the early hours of Monday.\n\u201cReports claiming that HRH the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman intends on buying Man United are completely false,\u201d Al-Shabanah tweeted from a verified account linked to his position in government. It would appear a fairly formal denial, though Saudi Arabia doesn't have the best record in those recently, having also denied carrying out the murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi until all the incontrovertible evidence piled up, resulting in the blaming of 'rogue elements' for a torture, murder and suspected dismemberment that is believed to have taken place within the Saudi consulate itself.\nAl-Shabanah tweeted that United had held a meeting with Saudi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u201cto discuss sponsorship opportunity\" but no deal materialised. So there was, at the very least, a small fire from which this smoke emerged, and even though there are those who doubt the substance of any Saudi denial, it must be acknowledged that buying out a Premier League club doesn't necessarily fit with the kingdom's policy on sporting investment.\nNext Manchester United manager Show all 8 1 / 8 Next Manchester United manager Next Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - 1/5 Not considered a candidate upon accepting the caretaker's job, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is now the front-runner after restoring harmony to Old Trafford.\nThe former Manchester United striker has reintroduced an attacking, direct brand of football that has rejuvenated hopes of a top-four finish.

Reuters\nIndeed, their strategy over the past decade has focused on strengthening domestic sport while neighbours went all-out overseas.\nInvestment has increased in Saudi Arabia's football league and leading clubs, who now draw significant crowds, have been privatised with a hope they can one day compete with Europe's finest - perhaps in a lucrative, Saudi-funded World League environment. As in Qatar, a rival state in the region, Saudi Arabia has built a sports and entertainment city which represents one of the largest dedicated leisure and entertainment developments of its type in the world. It is hoped that this city, Qiddiya, will be able to host a number of sporting events in the future, with existing Saudi sports policy more centred around bringing major sporting competitions to the kingdom rather than investing billions in a Premier League football club as things stand.\nIn December, Formula E hosted a race in Ad Diriyah. As one of the world's most eco-friendly and fastest-growing sports, it was a coup for Saudi Arabia and Wayne Rooney was among the celebrities and influencers paid significant sums to visit the kingdom for the race, drawing attention to their hosting of the event.

Sign Up Now!\nDraftKings DFS Guards\nD'Angelo Russell - PG, BKN vs SAC (DK - $8.300)\nRussell is balling right now and has posted 47 DraftKings points or more in three of his last four games, with two of those games being over 55 DK points. He is in a spot to continue that strong trend tonight since he is facing off against the Kings, who are surrendering 49 DraftKings points per game to point guards this season, which is sixth worst in the league. Russell has also taken seven or more three-point attempts in three straight games, so plenty of scoring upside, which should make him viable in all formats. The favorable matchup and consistency are great for cash and the upside from three-pointers is great for tournaments.\nKris Dunn - SG, CHI @ CLE (DK - $6,100)\nDunn has a very favorable matchup today and comes in very reasonably priced tonight, which can always help with roster construction since it's an only five-game early slate. He has played 30 minutes or more in four of his last five games but has produced under one fantasy point per minute in four of those games. A slight bit of inconsistency, which could turn around today since he is up against the Cavaliers, who are giving up 41 DraftKings points per game to shooting guards, which is ninth worst in the league.\nDraftKings DFS Forwards\nKyle Kuzma - SF, LAL vs GS (DK - $7,600)\nIt was announced on Sunday that Lonzo Ball is going to be out for about a month, so more of the offense is going to fall onto Kuzma, as they are still without LeBron. Kuzma sees a 4.5% increase in his usage rate when those two players are off the court this season, giving him a total of 29.5%, along with producing 1.30 fantasy points per minute. He is a bit of a \"value\" tonight since his price hasn't been adjusted due to the recent injury news. We have an over-under set at 235 points versus the Warriors, so there will be plenty of scoring to go around and Kuzma should be firmly involved for the Lakers.\nP.J. Tucker - PF, HOU @ PHI (DK - $5,300)\nIs PJ Tucker and amazing fantasy player? No, but he is cheap and playing a ton of minutes right now, with over 39 in three of his last four games. Minutes equals money in NBA DFS, which is true, but we aren't getting massive numbers from Tucker, as he has over 24 DraftKings points in three of those four games. Yes, that is under one fantasy point per minute and he will always give up offensive usage to Harden, but he is up against the 76ers tonight in a game with an over-under set at 234 and will be playing full minutes yet again.\nDraftKings DFS Centers\nNikola Vucevic - C, ORL @ ATL (DK - $9,500)\nVucevic has been a fantasy monster in recent games, posting over 43 DraftKings points in seven of his last 10, making him a very expensive, but worthwhile spend today. He is facing off against the Hawks who are giving up 56 DraftKings points per game to centers this season, along with playing some of the worst defense overall this season. Vucevic is averaging 1.45 fantasy points per minute this season, which is insanely productive, coming from the fact he is a double-double machine.\n[jiffyNews category_include='9056'", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "7006947084722658921", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.rotoballer.com/draftkings-daily-fantasy-basketball-picks-1-21-19-nba-dfs-lineups/598974", "ms_text": "O__ e________ D__ t____, L_____ O________ a__ d____ P______ D__ R_______.", "full_text": "We have a split slate of games with five in the early window starting at 1 pm, while we have a four-game slate starting at 6 pm.

Read More!\nDraftKings DFS Guards\nDamian Lillard - PG, at OKC ($8,100)\nThere's little to no reason Lillard should be this cheap on only a four game slate. Over the last 10 days, he's averaging 27.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 6.5 assists (45.6 fantasy points) in 34.5 minutes per game over the last 10 days. He has scored 40+ fantasy points in each of his last six games. Lillard struggled a bit in his only matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder this season, but he was still able to produce 37.5 fantasy points in that game. He can safely be used in all leagues.\nKelly Oubre Jr. - SG/SF, vs MIN ($5,600)\nOubre has found his groove with the Phoenix Suns, and the return of Devin Booker hasn't derailed him. He's averaging 20.4 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.2 steals (36.3 fantasy points) in 28.3 minutes per game over the last 10 days. Oubre has scored 30+ fantasy points in six of his last seven games, and he's averaging a healthy 35.6 fantasy points per game over that span. Oubre posted 33 fantasy points in 29 minutes in his last matchup against Minnesota, and we could see similar production tonight. He's a solid option for his current price tag.\nDraftKings DFS Forwards\nKawhi Leonard - SF/PF, vs SAC ($9,300)\nLeonard is another elite option, who comes with a surprisingly low price tag. He has only played three games over the last 10 days, but he's averaging 31.3 points, 8.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 2.7 steals (55.5 fantasy points) in 36.0 minutes per game over that span. He has also scored between 50 and 74 fantasy points in four of his last five games, while averaging 56.9 fantasy points per game over that span. Leonard gets an elite matchup against the Sacramento Kings, who love pushing the pace and have struggled defensively. He makes one of the best options on the slate tonight.\nRichaun Holmes - PF/C, vs MIN ($4,100)\nHolmes is an interesting option tonight. He has struggled over his last two games, but was an extremely consistent option prior to that. Before those two games, Holmes had scored 20+ fantasy points in six of his last seven games. He's also averaging 26.6 fantasy points per game over that span. He's questionable tonight, so keep an eye on his status, but he'll make a great salary relief option if he's starting. With that being said, Holmes does come with quite a bit of risk, even for a low price tag.\nDraftKings DFS Centers\nDeAndre Jordan - C, vs LAC ($6,400)\nJordan gets a matchup against his former team, and he has dominated them this season. In two matchups against the Los Angeles Clippers, Jordan is averaging 13.5 points, 22.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.0 steal (51.1 fantasy points) in 33.1 minutes per game. Los Angeles has struggled against centers this season, specifically in terms of rebounding, and that is Jordan's strength. He makes an elite option for a surprisingly low price tag.\n[jiffyNews category_include='9056'", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "7006947084722658921", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.rotoballer.com/draftkings-daily-fantasy-basketball-picks-1-22-19-nba-dfs-lineups/599431", "ms_text": "O__ e________ D__ t____, L_____ O________ a__ d____ P______ D__ R_______.", "full_text": "After somewhat of an odd split slate yesterday, we're back to a small four game Tuesday slate.

Officers found the unconscious girl submerged about 75 feet off the shore. They loaded her into an ambulance and rushed her to the hospital, but it was already too late.\nThe Tampa Police Department says Denson was located walking not far from the scene where all of this happened.\nDetails on a possible motive were not immediately available.\nNews outlets reported that Denson was denied bail Friday during her first court appearance on first-degree murder charges. She was also charged with child abuse and auto theft. Authorities said Denson drove Je'Hyrah to the river in a stolen vehicle.\nIn 2015, police say a man threw his 5-year-old daughter to her death off the Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg. John Jonchuck Jr. is set for trial next month.\nThe Associated Press and KTRK-TV contributed to this report.", "sid": 7, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "16031281117223657274", "docid": 0, "url": "https://fox6now.com/2019/02/20/no-more-big-boobie-booty-cheerleading-awards-at-tremper-high-school-after-aclu-demanded-action/", "ms_text": "\u00d7 N_ m___ \u2018B__ B_____, B____\u2019 c___________ a_____ a_ T______ H___ S_____ a____ A___ d_______ a_____\nK______ \u2014 A W________ h___ s_____ i_ e_____ c___________ a_____ g____ a_______ t_ g____ w___ t__ l______ b______ o_ b_______ \u2014 d_____ \u201cB__ B____\u201d a__ \u201cB__ B_____\u201d \u2014 a____ t__ A_______ C____ L________ U____ d_______ a_____ f________ r_______ c_________ f___ p______ a__ a f_____ c____ t_ s_____ a__ d_______ o________.", "full_text": "KENOSHA \u2014 A Wisconsin high school is ending cheerleading awards given annually to girls with the largest breasts or buttocks \u2014 dubbed \"Big Booty\" and \"Big Boobie\" \u2014 after the American Civil Liberties Union demanded action following repeated complaints from parents and a former coach to school and district officials.\nCoaches at Tremper High School in the Kenosha Unified School District give out awards each year recognizing the most improved or hardest-working cheerleaders. In at least the past two years, they have also given what they called gag awards, according to the ACLU of Wisconsin. Those awards also included one in 2018 for \"String Bean\" \u2014 the thinnest team member.\nThe ACLU, which sent a letter Tuesday, Feb. 19 demanding that the district discipline staff involved with the awards, said emails and other documents it obtained during a yearlong investigation showed the awards were handed out at a banquet attended by about 100 people, including coaches, family members and friends of students.\nDetails about the awards banquet were first reported by the New York Times.\nAmong those who complained was Patti Hupp, former track coach. She emailed Principal Steve Knecht last year to express her concerns after a parent notified her about the awards.\n\"I don't think it takes much to see that this is extremely degrading to women,\" Hupp said in the email to Knecht.\nKnecht told cheerleading coaches in an April 28 email that he would launch an investigation into the awards after receiving complaints from four different people. He later told a parent who followed up that he had found no evidence of wrongdoing. When the parent asked for justification, he wrote in a letter that the awards \"were meant to be funny\" and the coaches were \"just joking around.\"\nTanya Ruder, KUSD spokeswoman said \"a clear expectation has been set that awards of this nature are not acceptable and are not to be given at Tremper cheerleading banquets going forward.\" However, the Times reported that a coach sent a note to the team on Sunday about this year's awards banquet that said only cheerleaders and coaches are invited.\nHupp also emailed a cheerleading coach, Patti Uttech, on April 24 to express her concerns.\n\"The last thing these high school girls need is a fellow woman in their lives communicating to them that they are objects or that their appearance is something to be gawked at, demeaned, laughed at, or even awarded for that matter,\" Hupp wrote.\nUttech said she didn't see a problem.\n\"I honestly don't feel that I need to explain myself about how we ran our banquet,\" she said in her email response. \"Actually we have run it this way for years and have never had a problem.\"\nA human resources official met with Uttech a month after that email and directed her to write letters of apology to students and to resign by June 14, according to the documents obtained by the ACLU. However, Uttech has continued coaching the cheerleading squad, the ACLU said.\nRuder said the school district could not discuss personnel matters.\nHupp told the Kenosha News that she was not just disappointed with the school district.\n\"I'm disgusted with the cheer coaches and with the Kenosha parents that sat there and said and did nothing,\" Hupp said.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "16031281117223657274", "docid": 2, "url": "https://fox6now.com/2019/02/19/aclu-claims-kusd-students-objectified-sexualized-after-big-boobie-booty-cheer-awards-come-to-light/", "ms_text": "P_____ e_____ J_________ t_ w____ t___ v____\nK______ -- A___ o_ W________ o________ o_ T______, F__. 1_ i_____ a l_____ t_ K______ U______ S_____ D_______ o________ a___ c__________ i________ a_____ a_____ c_________ f__ t__ T______ H___ S_____ c___________ s____, a__ t__ h_____ c_________ a_ B_______ H___ S_____.", "full_text": "\nKENOSHA -- ACLU of Wisconsin officials on Tuesday, Feb. 19 issued a letter to Kenosha Unified School District officials amid controversy involving annual awards ceremonies for the Tremper High School cheerleading squad, and the health curriculum at Bradford High School.

Additionally, the letter said during the 2017 banquet, \"a member of the cheerleading squad with brown hair received a blonde wig because she was deemed a ditzy girl.\" The ACLU said parents indicated Tremper cheer coaches made sexual remarks about the girls and have harassed them, to the point where \"students have left practice in tears, have felt shame about their bodies and have quit the squad due to comments made by the coaches.\"\nThe ACLU said these same controversial awards were handed out in 2018, and they received video of coaches handing out the \"Big Booty Judy Award.\"\nParents and a coach reached out to the principal at Tremper after the 2018 awards ceremony, and through an open records request, the ACLU received an emails from April. Those emails showed a coach reached out to a cheer coach with concerns over the banquet and the awards' effect on the young women, and the cheer coach responded \"I honestly don't feel that I need to explain myself about how we ran our banquet. Actually we have ran it this way for years and have never had a problem.\" A follow-up email from the principal to the cheer coaches revealed four complaints. The Tremper principal said he'd be launching an investigation.\nThe ACLU said there was \"persistent follow up\" from one parent, and the principal told that parent he \"could find no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the coaches,\" and that the awards \"were meant to be funny\" and the coaches were \"just joking around.\"\n\nSchool district administrators were also notified, according to the ACLU, and an administrator met with a parent in April of 2018 and reiterated what the principal said.\nA district human resources official met with the lead cheer coach in May of 2018, the ACLU said, and directed the coach to write apology letters to the girls who received the controversial awards, and to submit her resignation by mid-June. A follow-up memo from the principal to the superintendent in August indicated while the coach did send apology emails, she \"declined to resign.\" The ACLU said the principal told the head coach \"she was welcome back as co-coach\" with her supposed replacement, and continued to directly coach the squad through the 2018-2019 school year.\nThe ACLU noted in their letter that \"this awards event is not an isolated incident\" and said \"KUSD teachers and administrators have selectively enforced the dress code against female students in a manner that reinforces invidious stereotypes\" -- sending the message to girls that \"their worth lies in their physical appearance, not their academic or athletic abilities.\"\n\"When you have girls as young as 14 on this team, to say that calling someone up in front of hundreds of people and calling attention to her breasts, her buttocks, her frame and saying that's a joke is more than inappropriate. It's likely against the law,\" said Asma Kadri Keeler.\nIncident related to health curriculum at Bradford High School\n\nBradford High School\n\nAs for Bradford High School, the ACLU's letter said in December of 2018, students watched a movie as part of their health curriculum in which a college freshman was drugged and raped by a fraternity brother. They were then asked to fill out a worksheet that asked, \"What could Melissa have done differently to have avoided her sexual assault? Provide at least four examples.\" The ACLU said this question \"squarely places the blame for a sexual assault on the victim, rather than the perpetrator.\"\nAccording to the ACLU, multiple parents submitted complaints to school district officials, and KUSD leaders stated \"Bradford was asked to promptly remove this assignment from use.\" Administrators said they would take part in a comprehensive review of the health curriculum \"to avoid future incidents.\" The ACLU noted to their knowledge, KUSD officials have not informed students and families about the results of that review, or any steps taken to remedy this.\n\nBradford High School\n\nThe ACLU noted in their letter \"as a recipient of federal funds, KUSD must comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\" which prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual harassment.\"\nThe ACLU called for \"appropriate discipline\" against staff, mandatory anti-harassment training for all employees, written guidelines for staff prohibiting remarks on appearance, students' bodies or sexuality, the release of KUSD's \"comprehensive review\" of the health curriculum and a new sex education curriculum that \"emphasizes healthy relationships.\"\nThey asked for a response from the district by March 1.\nA spokeswoman with the Kenosha Unified School District released this statement to FOX6 News:\n", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "16031281117223657274", "docid": 2, "url": "https://fox6now.com/2019/02/19/aclu-claims-kusd-students-objectified-sexualized-after-big-boobie-booty-cheer-awards-come-to-light/", "ms_text": "\"T_ s__ t___ t____ i_ n_ e_______ o_ w_________ i______ t__ f___ t___ t___________ a__ e_______ o_ w_________.\"\nA___ o________ s___ t___ r_______ r______ f___ f_____ s_____ d_______ e________ a__ c______ p______ a__ s_______, s___________ a_ T______, t_ i_______ t__ c______ h____ b_ t__ d_______ \"e______ i_ s_____ h_________, s__ d_____________ a__ b___ s______ a_ a_ a_____ a_____ e____.\" T___, i_ a_______ t_ r______ t___ t_______ a_ B_______ \"a__ t_______ s_______ a____ s_____ a______ i_ a m_____ t___ i______________ b_____ v______ f__ t____ a_______.\"\nI________ r______ t_ T______ H___ S_____ c___________ s____\nA________ t_ t__ l_____ f___ t__ A___, r______ c___ i_ t___ a_____ w___ b____ h_____ o__ a_ t__ a_____ T______ H___ S_____ c___________ s____ b______ a_ t__ e__ o_ e___ s_____ t___ o________ t__ y____ w____'s b_____, i________ t__ \"B__ B_____ A____,\" t__ \"S_____ B___ A____\" a__ t__ \"B__ B____ J___ A____.\" T___ w__ d___ i_ 2___, a________ t_ t__ l_____.", "full_text": "\nKENOSHA -- ACLU of Wisconsin officials on Tuesday, Feb. 19 issued a letter to Kenosha Unified School District officials amid controversy involving annual awards ceremonies for the Tremper High School cheerleading squad, and the health curriculum at Bradford High School.

Standing on the podium at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists to make the Black Power salute, a symbol of defiance against racism and injustice.\nThe silent protest, which took place 50 years ago yesterday, was initially condemned by the International Olympic Committee but is now seen as a watershed moment in the battle for equality. The demonstration came at a time of major social upheaval; Martin Luther King Jr, the figurehead of the civil rights movement, was assassinated just six months earlier.\nWho are Tommie Smith and John Carlos?\nTommie Smith, who performed the Black Power salute alongside John Carlos, won the gold medal for the 200-metre sprint event at the 1968 Olympics. Smith completed the race in just 19.83 seconds, breaking his own world record. His US teammate Mr Carlos finished third with a time of 20.06 seconds, while Australian athlete Peter Norman took the silver medal.\nAs the American national anthem played during the victory ceremony, Mr Smith and Mr Carlos bowed their heads and raised their black-gloved fists. The pair both wore black socks and no shoes, in memory of black people who had been lynched, while Mr Carlos wore a necklace of black beads.\n\u201cI looked at my feet in my high socks and thought about all the black poverty I\u2019d seen from Harlem to East Texas,\u201d Mr Carlos, who is now 74, would later write in his autobiography. \u201cI fingered my beads and thought about the pictures I\u2019d seen of the \u2018strange fruit\u2019 swinging from the poplar trees of the South.\u201d\nSpeaking earlier this year, Mr Smith said he wanted to use his platform to make a powerful statement about racial equality. \u201cI knew it [the salute] would have an impact but I didn\u2019t know how far it would go,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cThat was my chance. I had a platform.\u201d\nThe former athletes have both been inducted into the US Track and Field Hall of Fame.\nRio 2016 Olympics - in pictures Show all 74 1 / 74 Rio 2016 Olympics - in pictures Rio 2016 Olympics - in pictures Day Eight Andy Murray celebrates his victory over Kai Nishikori to reach the men's Olympic final.

After the Games, he said: \u201cI believe that every man is born equal and should be treated that way.\u201d\nIn a 2012 interview, Mr Smith reflected: \u201cPeter was a man in his own right\u2026 Peter backed himself. He did not need Tommie Smith and John Carlos to believe in what he did. He just happened to be blessed to be on the victory stand with two people who believed in what he did. And that was the power of that human rights stand in Mexico City in 1968 \u2013 togetherness.\u201d\nMr Norman died following a heart attack in 2006, aged 64. Both Mr Smith and Mr Carlos gave eulogies and were pall-bearers at his funeral.\nFrom left, Peter Norman with Tommie Smith and John Carlos in 1968 (AP)\nHow did people respond to the Black Power salute?\nThe International Olympic Committee condemned Mr Smith and Mr Carlos\u2019 protest, deeming it a political statement and \u201ca deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit\u201d.\nThe US athletes were promptly suspended from their country\u2019s Olympic team and sent home, where they received death threats and hate mail. Both men were widely vilified and struggled for years to make a living.\nTime magazine called the protest a \u201cpublic display of petulance that sparked one of the most unpleasant controversies in Olympic history\u201d, adding: \u201c\u2019Faster, Higher, Stronger\u2019 is the motto of the Olympic Games. \u2018Angrier, nastier, uglier\u2019 better describes the scene in Mexico City last week.\u201d\nHowever, the blacked-glove fist has since become an enduring symbol of the fight for racial equality and justice. Mr Smith said he believes that there is much broader support for non-violent protest nowadays than in 1968. Pointing to the success of the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements, he said: \u201cThings are getting bigger and better and, if one doesn\u2019t watch out, control [of protests] will be very, very difficult.\u201d", "sid": 5, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "5631201490626155630", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/ivanka-trump-mocked-after-quoting-chinese-proverb-isnt-chinese-972219", "ms_text": "\u00e2    T____ w__ s__ i_ c__ n__ b_ d___, s_____ n__ i________ t____ d____ i_.\u00e2     -C______ P______ \u00e2     I_____ T____ (@I__________) J___ 1_, 2___\nU____________ f__ I_____, t__ p______ i_ a_________ n__ C______.", "full_text": "Ivanka Trump has found herself the subject of Twitter mockery after misattributing a quote as an old \"Chinese proverb.\"\nAs her father President Donald Trump was in Singapore for an historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the first daughter took to social media to share some wisdom.\n\"Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it.\" -Chinese Proverb \" Ivanka wrote in a tweet on Monday.\n\u201cThose who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it.\u201d -Chinese Proverb \u2014 Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 11, 2018\nUnfortunately for Ivanka, the proverb is apparently not Chinese.\nAnd Twitter users in the know were quick to point out the misattribution. \" Those who say it can not be done, should not interrupt those doing it! \"Fake\" Chinese proverb Ivanka where did u get this ???,\" one user wrote, while another added: \"This is not a real Chinese proverb but it's nice to know you can use google for fake quotes.\"\nShanghai publication Shanghaiist noted that the quote was first used in a Chicago periodical in 1903.\nBut according to Quote Investigator website, Ivanka's tweet was liked more than 70,000 times.\nProfessor of Chinese at Calvin College in Michigan, Larry Herzberg, told The New York Times the tweet was \"yet one more example of Americans ascribing a quote to the Chinese, often to Confucius, when they don't really know the origin of the saying.\"\n\"It sounds more legitimate and credible to pronounce a quote coming from the ancient civilization of China,\" he added.\nIt is not the first time Ivanka has misattributed a quote she's shared on social media, she was also caught out misquoting Albert Einstein in July last year.\n\"If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts,\" she wrote, attributing the quote to Einstein, before quickly being informed by other Twitter users that this was not an Einstein quote.", "sid": 2, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "14497083460803873518", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45598156", "ms_text": "I____ c________ T______/H________@J___ I____ c______ A p______ t____ b_ o__ o_ t__ r_____ o_ t__ a_______'s s______.", "full_text": "We are sorry we have kept you waiting!

JAXA said the release went successfully.\nThe solar-powered rovers\u2019 voltage plunged as night fell on Ryugu, a sign that they are on the asteroid, according to Hayabusa project team spokesman Takashi Kubota.\nNasa's most stunning pictures of space Show all 30 1 / 30 Nasa's most stunning pictures of space Nasa's most stunning pictures of space Solar Flare An image from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun's corona in September 2013 Nasa Nasa's most stunning pictures of space Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of Spacewalking For 50 years, NASA has been \"suiting up\" for spacewalking.

He was struck multiple times in the torso and head, and later died of his injuries at a hospital, according to the video.\nAdvertisement\nLAPD Capt. Patricia Sandoval identified the male officer in the video as Miguel Alarcon of the Mission Division but would not identify the female officer because she has \u201cconfidentiality protection as a victim of a violent crime.\u201d\nOfficers on the police car camera are seen pulling over Mendoza, who was driving a silver Nissan Altima on Noble Avenue in North Hills at about 10:15 p.m. July 27. The female officer approaches the driver\u2019s-side door while her partner goes to the passenger-side door.\nThe female officer appears to recognize Mendoza, as someone who is on federal probation. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d she tells Mendoza. \u201cYou still on probation?\u201d\nMendoza replies that he has nine more months of probation. Her partner\u2019s body cam shows that during the conversation, Mendoza\u2019s hands are up and visible.\nShe asks him to step out of the vehicle.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything on you, right?\u201d the officer asks. She then opens the driver\u2019s-side door, but as Mendoza steps toward her, he draws the handgun from his right side and fires at close range. Her body camera captures the gun pointing directly at her chest.\nMendoza fires with his right hand at the female officer, hitting her and then swivels to shoot over the car rooftop at her partner. The male officer ducks and leans over the Altima, firing at Mendoza before coming behind the vehicle to the driver\u2019s side and shooting again. The female officer can be heard screaming in pain.\nA bloody Mendoza lies motionless on the ground next to his car.\nThe male officer radios for assistance: \u201cOfficers needs help, shots fired. Officer needs help; shots fired. Noble, south of Plummer.\u201d\nThe female officer tells her partner, \u201cIn my left leg.\u201d He assures her she will be OK as he leans over her to examine her wound, exclaiming, \u201cOh my God.\u201d\nReferring to the shooter, she then tells her colleague, \u201cJust get him.\u201d\nThe other officer handcuffs Mendoza behind his back, with blood visibly flowing from his wounds.\nThe female officer was treated by paramedics at the scene before being transported to a hospital.\nIn an interview Monday, LAPD Chief Michel Moore commented on how narrowly both officers escaped greater harm.\n\u201cBy the grace of God she is alive,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOfficers are fearful in these situations and the public here gets to see why.\n\u201cOnce a person has you in that position it is very tough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot stop that first one or two shots.\u201d\nThe chief said the female officer, who worked the gang unit, knew Mendoza on sight and was aware of his history.\nMendoza, who went by the name of \u201cBiz,\u201d was known by the LAPD as a member of the Vincent Town street gang. He has prior convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon and narcotics for sales, according to the LAPD and court records.\nMoore said the male partner\u2019s ability to confront the armed driver quickly and decisively saved both their lives and illustrates why officers approach on both sides of a vehicle.\nThe chief said the shot shattered the female officer\u2019s femur in her upper leg. \u201cI spoke with her, she is OK,\u201d he said, adding that she is continuing to mend.\nThe LAPD released the video under a new policy that requires recordings to be made public within 45 days of a shooting by a police officer. Moore said the videos provide context and highlight the danger officers face in traffic stops.\nAlan Hamilton, an LAPD commander who oversees the department\u2019s Force Investigation Division, said his unit is investigating the North Hills incident, which will examine all aspects of the shooting including the tactics.\nrichard.winton@latimes.com\nTwitter: @lacrimes\nUPDATES:\n8:40 p.m.: This article was updated with the identity of the male officer.\nThis article was originally published at 5:10 p.m.", "sid": 6, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "4997125461414186250", "docid": 2, "url": "https://abc7.com/video-gunman-shoots-lapd-officer-during-traffic-stop/4203413/", "ms_text": "L__ A______ (K___) -- L__ A______ p_____ r_______ s_______ v____ o_ M_____ s______ a m__ s_______ a f_____ o______ d_____ a t______ s___ i_ N____ H____ i_ J___.T__ i_______ o_______ o_ J___ 2_ a_____ 1_ p.m. n___ P______ S_____ a__ N____ A_____.I_ t__ n____ r_______ v____, t__ f_____ o______ i_ s___ a_____ t__ d_____ t_ g__ o__ o_ t__ c__, w____ h__ j___ b___ p_____ o___.\"Y__ d__'t h___ a_______ o_ y__, r____?\" t__ o______ a___.", "full_text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles police released shocking video on Monday showing a man shooting a female officer during a traffic stop in North Hills in July.\nThe incident occurred on July 27 around 10 p.m. near Plummer Street and Noble Avenue.\nIn the newly released video, the female officer is seen asking the driver to get out of the car, which has just been pulled over.\nMORE: LAPD officer shot in the leg during officer-involved shooting in North Hills\n\"You don't have anything on you, right?\" the officer asks.

Police were called to the scene about 6:40 p.m., after the driver appeared to accelerate as he moved into a crosswalk full of pedestrians, Ngo said in a video posted to the department\u2019s Facebook page.\nA witness told investigators the driver was heard to say \u201csomething similar to, \u2018Thank you, God,\u2019\u201d after plowing through the crosswalk and crashing into a tree, Ngo said. Evidence suggested the driver intentionally struck the pedestrians.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no apparent connection between the suspect and the victims,\u201d the chief said.\nDon Draper told CNN he spoke with the suspect moments after the crash.\n\u201cI made the mistake of yelling at him in his own car,\u201d Draper said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I heard him saying, \u2018I love you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.\u2019 \u201c\nThe victims ranged in age from 9 to 52, with a 13-year-old suffering the most serious injuries and admitted to a hospital in critical condition, according to Ngo. A 32-year-old woman, a 33-year-old man and a 52-year-old man suffered major injuries and were admitted in stable condition. The others were either treated at the scene or treated at hospitals and released.\nThe suspect was identified as Isaiah Joel Peoples, a 34-year-old Sunnyvale resident who was born in San Francisco, the public safety department said. It\u2019s unclear whether he has an attorney. CNN reached out to the public defender\u2019s office to see whether it is involved.\nPeoples was arrested at the scene of the crash. He was unhurt.\nNgo said police obtained a search warrant for his apartment as part of the investigation.\nNo evidence has linked the suspect to any terrorist organization and it appears Peoples acted alone, Ngo said.\nSunnyvale Avenue, between El Camino Real and Old San Francisco, will be closed until 8 a.m. Two lanes of westbound El Camino Real will be open.

There has been a rise in hate crimes \u2014 nationally and in California.\n\u201cFor this to happen in a progressive and diverse region like the ... Bay Area is a reminder that no one and no region are exempt from the trend that we are seeing across the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat there\u2019s a possibility that this was motivated by anti-Muslim bias is very concerning.\u201d\nAuthorities haven\u2019t released information on the religion of the crash victims.\nThe three people who sustained major injuries, besides the 13-year-old girl, were a 32-year-old woman and two men, ages 33 and 52. A 45-year-old man was treated and released from a hospital. A 15-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man were treated and released at the scene by paramedics.\nSix of the crash victims are from Sunnyvale; the other two reside in Santa Clara.\nSunnyvale is the Bay Area\u2019s seventh-largest city, with a population of about 153,000. It has a reputation as a quiet suburb, transformed from a land of orchards to an area for aerospace, defense and technology. The city\u2019s largest employers include Google, Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Apple.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nron.lin@latimes.com\n@ronlin", "sid": 9, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "9461396706749912850", "docid": 0, "url": "https://ew.com/news/2018/10/24/david-schwimmer-lookalike-robbery-suspect-response/", "ms_text": "F______ t___ T_ S___ N______ N__ G____ S_____\nD____ S________ i_ m_____ i_ c____ h_ h__ n______ t_ d_ w___ a r_____ r______ c________ b_ s______ w___ a_ u______ r__________ t_ h__.", "full_text": "David Schwimmer is making it clear he had nothing to do with a recent robbery committed by someone with an uncanny resemblance to him.\n\"Officers, I swear it wasn't me,\" he wrote on Twitter, captioning a spoof video of him re-enacting surveillance footage of the alleged crime. \"As you can see, I was in New York.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nCLAYTON, Mo. \u2014 The jury has returned from their deliberation with a verdict in the murder trial of Trenton Forster. He has been convicted of first-degree murder for the 2016 shooting death of St. Louis County Officer Blake Snyder. Trenton has been found guilty on all four charges. The counts include murder in the first degree, two counts armed criminal action, and assault on a police officer. This means a sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole.\nOne hundred police officers and department employees lined the fourth-floor hallway Friday as Blake Snyder\u2019s widow, mother, father, extended family, and friends walked to the courtroom to hear final arguments in the Trenton Forster murder trial Friday morning. Jurors spent Friday trying to determine if Forster committed first or second-degree murder.\nThe jury came back to the courtroom once Friday afternoon and asked for two things during their deliberations. They wanted to know the exact definition of, \u201cdeliberation and cool reflection.\u201d They also asked to see a specific exhibit from the trial. Said exhibit has not been released to the public.\nJudge Kerr read the jury their instructions today. She said that reflection and deliberation, no matter how brief, are an important part of determining a first-degree murder charge. Being high on drugs does not excuse a person from being responsible for the murder. The judge told jurors that psychosis and or hallucination does make a person not responsible.\nThe prosecution went first Friday morning. They played the final radio transmission of officer Snyder, with him telling the dispatcher that he was arriving on the scene, in effect his last words that were ever recorded. He said it all comes down to deliberation. If jurors believe Trenton deliberated then he\u2019s guilty of first-degree murder.\nProsecutor Alan Key showed the jury several social media posts showing Trenton\u2019s hate for police. He made statements to friends who testified saying, \u201cI\u2019ll kill a cop before I got back to jail.\u201d\nA paramedic testified that Trenton said in the ambulance the morning of the murder in 2016 that he would not have shot if he knew the person was a cop. He added, \u201cHe snuck up on me.\u201d\nThe prosecution says that isn\u2019t possible. Testimony shows Officer Snyder approached first saying, \u201cHey bud. Show me your hand.\u201d Police said \u201cShow me your hands\u201d about five times.\nThe prosecutor said Trenton knew exactly what was happening. He says that this was a classic case of suicide by cop. They say Trenton is a liar and a manipulator. He\u2019s been that way all his life. Family members said the same.\nKey called the psychologist\u2019s testimony on behalf of Trenton \u201ca joke.\u201d He said she disregarded evidence that did not prove her findings. She said that Trenton was bi-polar and on drugs at the time of the killing. The psychologist said he did not deliberate the murder or the shooting.\nThe attorney for the defense took jurors on a tour of Trenton\u2019s life this morning. He said that parenting by mom and dad was terrible. There was no attempt to rehabilitate him when he started drinking in middle school. The attorney showed a videotape taken on a friend\u2019s cell phone of Trenton so high on drugs that could hardly speak or communicate.\nTrenton was put in hospitals for mental problems several times. He was supposed to go to drug treatment for a few months. His father pulled him out after Trenton complained. There were times that police took Trenton to the hospital because he threatened suicide or to kill family members.\nThe defense attorney then focused on the days and hours leading up to the murder. Trenton was homeless and family members would not let him live with them. He was constantly impaired on drugs, he threatened suicide, and talked about hating cops.\nThe attorney told jurors they must decide if his bi-polar manic phase impacted his behavior and his awareness so he could not deliberate or cooly reflect when he pulled the trigger. He said Trenton was in such a state, bipolar and high on drugs and paranoid he reacted to the officer there was no cognition going on. He was not aware of anything and he reacted.\nThe prosecution wrapped up saying Trenton is a liar and manipulative. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic case of suicide by cop,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the most selfish things you can do, but it\u2019s right up Trenton\u2019s alley.\u201d\nHe reminded jurors that being on drugs is not a defense. He said when Officer Snyder said, \u201cShow me your hands,\u201d for Trenton it was time: he was going in a box (coffin) or to jail.\n\u201cI hope this helps them on their path to healing.\u201d \u2013 St. Louis Co.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nCLAYTON, Mo. \u2013 The jury in the trial of a man accused of killing a St. Louis County police officer Blake Snyder heard closing arguments Friday morning. They have now begun deliberations. A decision could come as early as Friday afternoon.\nThe defense in the Trenton Forster murder trial admits he killed officer Snyder but that he`s not guilty of first-degree murder. His lawyers have been using his troubled past as a defense.\nBefore noon Thursday, nine witnesses were called to the stand to speak to Forster\u2019s alarming behavior in his past. The defense called two police officers who responded to calls for help for Forster due to him making suicidal threats.\nThey both spoke about his alleged mental capacity during those interactions. The defense then called a paramedic from the morning Forster shot Officer Synder. She spoke about him yelling in the ambulance and saying that he told her if he had known it was a cop who came up to his window, he wouldn`t have shot him. She testified that Forster told her Synder snuck up to his vehicle.\nTo give a glimpse into Forster`s adolescent years, the defense called his aunt, brother, mother and father to testify. They each spoke about him being an angry child who had problems with alcohol at a very young age.\nOver 100 officers from several departments line the hall of the 4th floor of the St. Louis County Courthouse to support the Snyder family during Trenton Forster murder trial pic.twitter.com/nK0ZRFDvUl \u2014 FOX2now (@FOX2now) February 8, 2019\nOfficers on the 4th floor of the St. Louis County Courthouse in Clayton line up to show support for Officer Snyder's family as they walk to the courtroom. pic.twitter.com/tvTPBuvFZf \u2014 FOX2now (@FOX2now) February 8, 2019", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "3467234231566080116", "docid": 0, "url": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/397303-gingrich-putin-press-conference-was-most-serious-mistake-of", "ms_text": "F_____ S______ N___ G_______ (R-G_.), a l_______ s________ o_ P________ T____ D_____ J___ T__________: D_________ p___________ 'n__________,' 'c____ n__ f_____ i_' B_____ t___ B___ h_ w__ c________ T____ d__ f_____ f__ a________: r_____ D_________: B_____ a__________ w____ n__ c_________ i__________ o______ M___, d_______ o_ M_____ t___ T____'s p__________ a_ a n___ c_________ w___ R______ P________ V_______ P____ w__ \"t__ m___ s______ m______ o_ h__ p_________.\"\nP________ T____ m___ c______ h__ s_________ i_ H_______ o_ o__ i___________ s_____ a__ P____.", "full_text": "Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a longtime supporter of President Trump, declared on Monday that Trump\u2019s performance at a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201cthe most serious mistake of his presidency.\u201d\nPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.

The good news is that the two passengers, NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin have landed safe and have been picked up by a search and rescue helicopter. The bad news is that there is now no reliable means of taking crew to and from the ISS.\n{mosads}NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine explained that \u201cshortly after launch, there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted, resulting in a ballistic landing of the spacecraft.\u201d\nAccording to NASA, Hague and Ovchinin have been rescued and are in good condition. They are headed to Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia outside of Moscow.\nNASA is monitoring the situation and \u201cworking closely with Roscosmos to ensure the safe return of the crew. Safety of the crew is the utmost priority for NASA. A thorough investigation into the cause of the incident will be conducted,\u201d according to a statement.\nThe Russian government has already formed a state commission to investigate the cause of the accident. However, it seems clear that in combination with the hole found in the Soyuz now docked with the ISS, Roscosmos has developed a quality control problem that has become systemic.\nIn the meantime, NASA\u2019s commercial crew program continues to experience delays, according to Space News.\nCurrently, the first uncrewed spaceflight for the SpaceX Dragon is scheduled for January 2019 while the first crewed test flight has been pushed back to June 2019. The first uncrewed flight for the Boeing CST-100 Starliner is not scheduled to happen until March 2019 and the first crewed test flight will occur on August 2019. NASA still hoped to have an operational test flight of the Dragon on August 2019 and for the CST-100 in December 2019.\nAs a practical matter, NASA\u2019s safety culture will likely prevent it from accelerating the commercial crew timetable. However, the June and August test flights might double as operational missions, taking new crews to the ISS and retrieving the current crews.\nIn the meantime, NASA and Roscosmos has a number of options. They could try to maintain the current crew on the ISS until the commercial crew spacecraft are available or the Soyuz is certified safe to fly. Cargo resupply can keep the people on board the space station supplied with consumables.\nOn the other hand, NASA and Roscosmos may explore the option of running the ISS without a crew until the commercial crew vehicles are ready or the Soyuz is pronounced safe to fly again, whichever comes first. Such a mode of operation has never been done before and entails some risk.\nThe current state of affairs in which the world is dependent on using just one spacecraft has its origins in the Bush-era decision to retire the space shuttle fleet. The idea was that the cost of operating the orbiters would then be plowed into the then Constellation program that, among other things, would develop the Orion spacecraft as a new ISS taxi.\nAt the time, NASA only anticipated a two-year \u201dspace gap\u201d during which the Soyuz would be relied on to access the $100 billion space station.\nHowever, delays in the development of the Orion and the program to develop commercial alternatives for space access provided an excuse for the Obama administration to cancel the Constellation program root and branch and double down on the commercial crew program.\nAngered by the decision, Congress initially underfunded the program to develop commercial spacecraft. The underfunding plus the usual technical problems that attend aerospace development projects expanded the two-year space gap to one lasting at least eight years. Thus, human spaceflight is facing yet another crisis made by ill-considered policy decisions by governments.\nMark Whittington is the author of space exploration studies \u201cWhy is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon? as well as \u201cThe Moon, Mars and Beyond.\u201d", "sid": 4, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "18167732104013593309", "docid": 0, "url": "https://fox8.com/2018/06/05/video-former-osu-football-player-arrested-accused-of-assaulting-officer/", "ms_text": "P_____ e_____ J_________ t_ w____ t___ v____\nD_____, O___ \u2014 A f_____ O___ S____ a__ C______ B____ o________ l______ h__ b___ c______ w___ f_____ a______ o_ a p_____ o______.", "full_text": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

balls and Hafeez hit an unbeaten 71 off 63 deliveries as Pakistan chased down a target of 267 with five balls to spare.\nHashim Amla\u00b4s 27th one-day international century was not enough for South Africa, who lost only two wickets in scoring 266 runs after winning the toss.\nPakistan\u00b4s bowlers deserved credit for their team\u00b4s win, which came after the tourists were well-beaten in all three Test matches.\nPakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed used his bowlers in short spells and their mixture of seam and spin proved better suited to a slow pitch than South Africa\u00b4s attack.\nSouth African strike bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Duanne Olivier conceded a combined 124 runs in 19.1 overs.\nThe Pakistan batsmen also proved better at rotating the strike, particularly during a 94-run second-wicket stand between Imam and Babar Azam (49).\n_____________________________________________________________________\nPakistan win by 5 wickets\nRabada to Shadab Khan, 1 run\nEnd of over 49:

Shadab Khan, Imad Wasim, Fahim Ashraf, 0 Hasan Ali, Usman Shinwari\nSouth Africa batting:\nHashim Amla and Reeza Hendrick are opening the innings while Faheem Ashraf will bowl the first over.\nPORT ELIZABETH: South Africa have won the toss and decided to bat first against Pakistan in the first game of the five-match One-day International (ODI) series in Port Elizabeth on Saturday .\nThe match starts at 04:00 pm (PST) and will be covered live by this website.\nPakistan will make all the efforts to bounce back from the setback of 3-0 Test series defeat to gain the momentum ahead of the world cup. Pakistan are said to be a more cohesive unit in the shorter format of the game and stand fifth on the ICC ODI Team Rankings.\nFaf du Plessis, South Africa captain, also said on Friday that Pakistan are a better one-day team than the hosts.\nSouth Africa's captain, after training session at St George\u2019s Park, said, \"Pakistan is a very good one day side and probably they would be the first to say that from a performance point of view, their one-day team is much stronger.\"\nPakistan\u2019s pace bowlers Hasan Ali, Mohammad Amir and Shaheen Afridi will enjoy bowling on the seam-friendly conditions in Port Elizabeth. The teenager Shaheen impressed in bursts during the Test series, claiming nine Proteas scalps in two games.\nWhile green shirts will heavily depend on their experienced batting line-up, like Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez.\nMeanwhile, South Africa will hope to extend their dominant run of form into white-ball cricket. Du Plessis will be keen to get a series victory under his belt ahead of the ICC World Cup 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re a one day side that\u2019s still trying to find that balance in our team,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cWith Quinny [de Kock] and Dale [Steyn] not here in the first two games, it actually gives us an opportunity to look at what else we need to look at, which is important.\u201d\nThe South Africa's bowling attack looks potent with the likes of Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, and Andile Phehlukwayo in their ranks. Additionally, Duanne Olivier, who was exceptional in the Tests, has also been drafted into the 14-man squad in place of the rested Dale Steyn for the first two ODIs.\n\n", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "13867652714268297913", "docid": 0, "url": "https://www.theroot.com/louisiana-teacher-makes-racist-facebook-post-but-its-ok-1828963266", "ms_text": "V______ S_____ S_________ : W__-T_\nI______ o_ p______ a m___ o_ B____ T______, a L________ h___ s_____ t______ t___ t_ W____ F_______ t_ o____ h__ w___-t______-o__ s________ f__ s___ o_ A______\u2019s t_______ c_________ b_ s_________ t___ y__-k___-w__ \u201cq___ a_____ l___ a______\u201d a__ c____ \u201cv_____ f__ h_______ a__ p__ t____.\u201d", "full_text": "We may earn a commission from links on this page.\nInstead of posting a meme on Black Twitter, a Louisiana high school teacher took to White Facebook to offer her well-thought-out solutions for some of America\u2019s toughest challenges by suggesting that you-know-who \u201cquit acting like animals\u201d and cease \u201cvoting for handouts and pay taxes.\u201d\nThere.

Per the trailer, the film will also explore the media circus that erupted in tandem with Bundy\u2019s 1979 trial, which saw the killer, serving as his own attorney, use his good looks and political savvy\u2014a fierce Republican, he once wanted to become a politician\u2014to enrapture the nation.\nJohn Malkovich, Jim Parson, Kaya Scodelario, Haley Joel Osment, and Metallica\u2019s James Hetfield co-star in the film, which has yet to lock down a release date .", "sid": 5, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "12169591575560783928", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-and-vile-trailer-2019-1", "ms_text": "A____________ T_____ f__ w_______!", "full_text": "\u2018Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, And Vile\u2019 Trailer: Watch Zac Efron Transform Into Ted Bundy\n\u201cI\u2019m more popular than Disney World.\u201d\nVoltage Pictures\nExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile has prompted somewhat mixed reviews following its premiere at Sundance.

Senate Judiciary Committee received the FBI report into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background Thursday, including allegations made against the judge by Christine Blasey Ford, chairman Chuck Grassley confirmed early Thursday morning.\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor at almost 10 p.m. Wednesday night, announced that senators will review the report.\nThe White House received the report Wednesday night, spokesperson Raj Shah said in a statement, that it is \"being transmitted to the Senate.\"\n\"The White House has received the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s supplemental background investigation into Judge Kavanaugh, and it is being transmitted to the Senate,\" Shah said. \"With Leader McConnell\u2019s cloture filing, Senators have been given ample time to review this seventh background investigation. This is the last addition to the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history, which includes extensive hearings, multiple committee interviews, over 1,200 questions for the record and over a half million pages of documents. With this additional information, the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\"\nMcConnell filed a motion that will kick off the process towards a final vote.\nMcConnell filed cloture on the nomination, which is a motion to bring debate to a close. The Senate will hold a cloture vote on Friday, and if it passes, it's likely the Senate will hold a final vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation sometime Saturday.\nIf they don\u2019t have the votes to cut off debate on Friday, it cannot move forward to a final vote.\nAll 100 senators will be able to access the report Thursday morning in rotating time blocks, starting at 8 a.m.\nSpeaking on the senate floor, McConnell said there will be \"plenty of time\" for senators to review the material before the Friday cloture vote.\nSenators are not expected to receive a full report of everything the FBI investigated in their week-long investigation \u2014 rather, they are expected to receive interview summaries without any conclusions drawn by the FBI, Republican Sen. Bob Corker told reporters after a closed-door GOP lunch on Capitol Hill. As is protocol, the FBI does not make conclusions in a background investigation.\n\u201cMy understanding is that they\u2019re just going to send us the raw data\u201d from the interviews, said Corker, who announced he would vote for Kavanaugh last week. Senators from both parties will then have a chance to ask an FBI official any questions they have.\nThe summaries will be made available to senators in a secured room, Corker said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walks at the Capitol in Washington, Oct. 3, 2018. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\nThe only people who will be able to access the summaries will be the senators and senior Judiciary Committee staff.\nAccording to McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, the FBI\u2019s report on the allegations are not expected to be made public. But there is a growing call \u2014 from both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 to have some version made public.\n\"I know yesterday [McConnell] said that was not going to be the case, but I have a feeling they're probably trying to figure out some way of disseminating this,\" Corker said.\nSen. Chris Coons, the Democrat from Delaware who worked with Republican Sen. Jeff Flake to stoke calls for an FBI report, said he didn\u2019t think details of confidential witness interviews should be made public due to an expectation of privacy, but that a summary of rough topics and the number of interviewees should be made available.\n\u201cI do think, in the interest of transparency, it would be appropriate for the FBI or the Senate to release that,\" Coons said.\nMany democrats have also expressed complaints that the report will be incomplete and not credible because the FBI didn't interview Ford and Kavanaugh.\nSen. Bob Corker speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, Oct. 3, 2018, in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a statement Wednesday afternoon saying the lack of interviews, including with witnesses identified by Kavanaugh\u2019s second accuser Deborah Ramirez, \u201craises serious concerns that this is not a credible investigation and begs the question: What other restrictions has the White House placed on the FBI?\u201d\nAccording to Ford\u2019s lawyers, they\u2019ve had no contact with anyone involved in the investigation, despite multiple requests. The FBI has also not contacted Julie Swetnick, Kavanaugh\u2019s third accuser.\nThe White House specifically requested FBI interviews with four people: Kavanaugh\u2019s high school friends Mark Judge and P.J. Smyth; Leland Keyser, who Dr. Christine Blasey Ford identified as at the gathering where she was assaulted; and Ramirez, whose lawyers provided a list of more than 20 additional witnesses to interview.\nMcConnell, who has fervently supported Kavanaugh from the beginning, vowed earlier this week that, despite Democrats\u2019 complaints, the Senate would vote by the end of the week.\n\"They'll read it as quickly as they can and that'll not be used as another reason for delay, I'll tell you that,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"We'll have an FBI report this week, and we'll have a vote this week.\"\n\"It\u2019s time to put this embarrassing spectacle behind us,\" he added on Wednesday morning.\nABC News' Trish Turner and Ali Rogin contributed to this report.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "4911254953393699723", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/politics/senators-fbi-report-kavanaugh/index.html", "ms_text": "(C__) T____ i_ a_ a_____ d_____ i_ t__ h____ o_ t__ U_____ S_____ S_____ a____ w______ t_ r______ t__ F__ b_________ r_____ a____ P________ D_____ T____'s S______ C____ n______ B____ K________, a d_______ t___ a_ o_ T______ e______ h__ y__ t_ a_____ o_ C______ H___.", "full_text": "CNN \u2014\nThere is an active debate in the halls of the United States Senate about whether to release the FBI background report about President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a document that as of Tuesday evening has yet to arrive on Capitol Hill.\nSeveral Republicans are pushing for public release because they have become convinced it will be exculpatory or, more cynically, they expect it to leak to the public anyway \u2013 and it\u2019s safer to have the full thing in view, not just cherry-picked parts that boost one side or another.\nBut that feeling does not include all Republicans.

The event kicked off with a conversation between White House senior adviser/Middle East fixer Jared Kushner and CNN political commentator Van Jones. (Kushner and Jones recently worked together on prison reform.) And boy, did that interview suck an unreasonably large amount of ass.\nThis is how this thing started, and it only got worse from there:\nAdvertisement\nI dunno man, \u201cnepotism\u201d seems like the obvious answer here. \u201cI did not plan my life to go into politics,\u201d Kushner responded, before calling the president \u201cmy father in law\u201d a bunch of times and waxing poetic about getting to \u201creally see the country and what he\u2019s fighting for.\u201d\nJared got to talk about his kids\u2019 pap pap, who thinks separating children from their families at the border is a good thing to do:\nJones also asked Kushner about his \u201cpower couple\u201d relationship with Ivanka Trump , something that no one has ever heard about and an incredibly crucial question to ask a senior adviser to the president. (He also called them an \u201cextraordinary couple.\u201d)\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like working with your wife every day, in that environment, with little kids?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow do you guys manage that?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJones wasn\u2019t done with the hard-hitting questions, such as: \u201cAre you having fun?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFinally, this is how Jones approached one of the more \u201cserious\u201d topics they discussed, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and Kushner\u2019s friendship with Saudi crown prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2014to whom Kushner has been accused of divulging a list of dissidents:\nJones: The core of the core of it, [the reason] that people are mad at Jared Kushner right now, is, I think people feel like, \u2018We got this American prince, he\u2019s making friends with the Saudi prince, but the Saudi prince, like, killed the dissident, and it\u2019s your fault, because if you hadn\u2019t been friends with him, he wouldn\u2019t have felt like he could\u2019ve gotten away with it.\u2019 How do you respond to critics like that?\nKushner: I\u2019m not...even sure where to start with that. Jones: [Laughs extremely hard] Kushner: Look, I don\u2019t respond to the critics.\ufeff\nFrost/Nixon, this was not.\nCNN, like The New Yorker and The Atlantic and every outlet that has its own Festival d\u2019Ideas, loves doing shit like this: having a liberal commentator interview a Trump administration official in order to \u201cchallenge\u201d their liberal viewership to engage different ideas or whatever. But given how openly hostile the administration is to CNN and its reporters, you\u2019d think that maybe they\u2019d want to take advantage of an opportunity for an extended interview with one of its top officials\u2014who, like his boss/father-in-law, has a metric ton of conflicts of interest\u2014to actually hold Kushner to account here.\nAdvertisement\nIf you\u2019re looking for more incredible content like Jake Tapper interviewing Jeff Flake on \u201cLessons Learned in Washington,\u201d you can watch the whole thing below. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, though.\nUpdate, 3:42 PM ET: Here\u2019s what Jones had to say in response to his interviewing style, emphasis mine :\n\u201cI thought it was important to challenge him, but I really wanted to make sure that he was able to explain himself without having to defend himself on everything, because when you get somebody like that talking, sometimes, just let them talk. People on Twitter are saying, cut him off, beat him up. I\u2019m like, \u2018This is the first time you\u2019re hearing him say something.

Indiana comes in having lost three straight. That's a simplistic look at how the team's are trending, but the Boilermakers are perhaps playing their most cohesive basketball at both ends of the floor. That could be most important for Purdue if Indiana limits Edwards, as it has done in holding him to 30 points in three previous meetings. The Boilermakers are beginning to find offensive consistency beyond their star guard.\n\u25ba Morgan collected 24 points, seven rebounds and two blocks in Purdue's win at Assembly Hall last season. Now he becomes the latest test for Williams, who impressed last week against Michigan State's Nick Ward and Wisconsin's Ethan Happ. While the freshman is far from a finished product, his physical presence gives the Boilermakers a look in this matchup it would not have had a month ago.\n\u25ba Phinisee (43.3 percent), Durham (41.5) and Morgan (41.3) are all shooting well from 3-point range, and Evan Fitzner (38.5) isn't far behind. Purdue ranks last among all Big Ten Conference teams in 3-point shooting defense at 37.3 percent. In the Boilermakers' six losses, that percentage jumps to 41.1 percent. One other player to keep an eye on: Langford shoots only 18.4 percent from 3 at home, but 32 percent away from Assembly Hall.\nNathan Baird reports on Purdue basketball for the Journal & Courier.

Langford is the best athlete on the IU basketball team, the best pro prospect \u2014 leading scorer and all that \u2014 but Eastern is a 6-6, 220-pound truck of a guard, and he didn\u2019t just take away Langford\u2019s game. He took away his will.\nPurdue embarrassed Indiana 70-55 on Saturday, taking apart the Hoosiers piece by piece and doing it so thoroughly that it would be nonsense to pin this loss on any one matchup, even a matchup that went as shockingly right for the Boilermakers as Nojel Eastern vs. Romeo Langford. But Romeo is a pretty big piece, arguably the Hoosiers\u2019 biggest. And Eastern demolished him.\nAfter Eastern stuffed Langford into a box and made him disappear for one half \u2014 poof! \u2014 Langford came out in the second half with a new strategy: Try to score when somebody else, anybody else, was guarding him. And that opportunity arose several times, either because IU was setting screens and Purdue was switching and Langford was now defended by Trevion Williams or Matt Haarms or Ryan Cline, or because Eastern was on the bench to get some rest. Hey, a guy gets tired shutting off an NBA lottery pick while producing the first double-double of his career, as Eastern did Saturday with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\nBy the end of the game, IU coach Archie Miller didn\u2019t even want Romeo on the floor. He substituted for Langford with 3:19 left and the Hoosiers trailing 62-48, leaving him on the bench for almost two minutes. Romeo wasn\u2019t in foul trouble (two fouls, both in the first half). Wasn\u2019t tired (just 22 minutes played). It was just: Romeo wasn\u2019t helping. In his 22 minutes on the court, IU was minus-16. In his 18 minutes off the court, IU outscored Purdue by a point.\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain any of that, because Romeo is not \u201coverrated,\u201d as the Purdue crowd was chanting throughout the second half. Before Saturday, Romeo had scored in double figures in each of Indiana\u2019s first 17 games, and in league play he was leading the Big Ten at 21.3 ppg. Romeo is exactly who we\u2019ve thought he was since his IndyStar Mr. Basketball tenure at New Albany: A scoring savant. A future NBA lottery pick.\nBut Eastern is one of the most difficult defenders in the country, an enormous college guard with NBA length and strength. He has the quickness to defend smaller players and the strength \u2014 he benches-presses right at 300 pounds \u2014 to defend the 6-6, 215-pound Langford. In just a minute I\u2019m going to show you what Eastern did to Langford, and what a few of his teammates did as well. But before we get there, let\u2019s make something clear:\nThis game wasn\u2019t a fluke. Not for either team. It was an accurate indicator of where each program is, right now. Where is IU? In the dumpster. On fire. The Hoosiers have lost four in a row, including back-to-back 15-point losses against Nebraska (at home) and Purdue.\nAnd again, let\u2019s not pin this loss solely on Romeo. Save a pin for IU coach Archie Miller, whose overall future I believe in, same as I believe in Romeo, but who has lost his team.\nMiller conceded as much after the Nebraska game \u2014 \u201cWhy guys aren\u2019t excited to get ready to go tonight, as much as we had at stake \u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Monday \u2014 and senior captain Juwan Morgan was equally disgusted. And it didn\u2019t get better on Saturday. No, it got worse. The Hoosiers couldn\u2019t make a 3-pointer (4-for-20), but by golly that didn\u2019t stop them from trying. They couldn\u2019t make a one-pointer either: 7-for-18 on free throws, and they had to make their last three just to do that.\nBut IU had more than a shooting problem, or a shot-selection problem. The Hoosiers looked silly on defense, allowing the 7-3 Haarms to roll to the basket unimpeded, time and time again, after setting screens for Carsen Edwards or Ryan Cline. IU was so spooked by the range of Edwards (20 points) and Cline (eight) that it ignored Haarms (12 points on 6-for-8 shooting, including four dunks), who spent the final 25 minutes dangling from the rim. The Hoosiers made zero adjustments. That\u2019s coaching. Let\u2019s call it what it is.\nAnd let\u2019s do the same for Purdue, which has won three in a row and six of seven \u2014 and which beat IU for the seventh time in eight games, the first 7-1 series spurt for either program since IU did it from 1972-76 \u2014 and point out how the Boilermakers are coming together at the same time the Hoosiers are falling apart. Matt Painter has developed Trevion Williams into a low-post monster who started on Saturday, and in Aaron Wheeler and Sasha Stefanovic he has two more quality pieces for a bench that now includes Haarms.\nHow much better is Purdue today than a month ago? A month ago, Carsen Edwards was scoring 40 efficient points (15-for-26 from the floor, 7-for-14 on 3-pointers) and Purdue was still losing 72-68 to Texas, the most galling point of a seven-game stretch where the Boilermakers went 2-5 with Edwards averaging 25 ppg. On Saturday, Purdue got an inefficient 20 points from Edwards \u2014 6-for-18 from the floor, 3-for-10 on 3-pointers \u2014 and still beat IU by 15.\nBut then, IU is in a dumpster. And the dumpster is on fire.\nInsider:IU's once-promising season is suddenly sinking, and concerns are justified\nAnd on Saturday it was Nojel Eastern lighting the match and throwing it on Langford, simply taking the ball from him for one of Langford\u2019s three turnovers in the first half, and swatting his 3-pointer out of the air in the second half, when Langford was still daring to shoot against him. All told Langford attempted 10 shots Saturday, but seven came when the primary defender was anyone else. Against Eastern, who was picking him up 35 feet from the rim and fighting around or through screens to stay on him, Langford was 0-for-3.\nLangford wasn\u2019t a whole lot better against everybody else (2-for-7). He tried a layup that Haarms pinned against the glass. Another time he attacked Aaron Wheeler, a really bad idea given Wheeler\u2019s 6-9 size and NBA hops. Whatever Romeo had in mind \u2014 dunk? layup? \u2014 will remain a mystery, because Wheeler met him in mid-air and swatted the ball before Langford could finish.\nBut Langford was at his worst against nobody at all. He missed all four of his free throws, and this happened the one time Langford was completely open on Saturday, a corner-3-pointer with Cline at least 10 feet away on the closeout.\nAir ball. Short.\nOh, Mackey Arena loved that.\nAir ball, they chanted. Air ball.\nThey were right about that one \u2014 it was, in fact, an air ball \u2014 but they were not correct when they chanted \u201coverrated\u201d at Langford. Unless, wait a minute, maybe they weren\u2019t chanting at Langford. Maybe they were referring to the entire IU team, which came into the game ranked 25th nationally.\nIn which case, yes, the crowd at Mackey Arena was correct. Because at No. 25 in the country, IU basketball is laughably overrated.\nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter: @GreggDoyelStar or at facebook.com/gregg.doyel.", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "4788233778046507554", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2019/01/19/purdue-destroyed-iu-basketball-nojel-eastern-crushed-romeo-langford/2618551002/", "ms_text": "I______ g____ R____ L_______ (0) g___ t___ u_ w___ P_____ g____ N____ E______ (2_) d_____ t__ s_____ h___ o_ a_ N___ c______ b_________ g___ i_ W___ L________, I__., S_______, J__. 1_, 2___.", "full_text": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 By the second half, with the crowd at Mackey Arena taunting him and the scoreboard saying something worse, Romeo Langford wasn\u2019t even trying to score against Purdue\u2019s Nojel Eastern.

Langford is the best athlete on the IU basketball team, the best pro prospect \u2014 leading scorer and all that \u2014 but Eastern is a 6-6, 220-pound truck of a guard, and he didn\u2019t just take away Langford\u2019s game. He took away his will.\nPurdue embarrassed Indiana 70-55 on Saturday, taking apart the Hoosiers piece by piece and doing it so thoroughly that it would be nonsense to pin this loss on any one matchup, even a matchup that went as shockingly right for the Boilermakers as Nojel Eastern vs. Romeo Langford. But Romeo is a pretty big piece, arguably the Hoosiers\u2019 biggest. And Eastern demolished him.\nAfter Eastern stuffed Langford into a box and made him disappear for one half \u2014 poof! \u2014 Langford came out in the second half with a new strategy: Try to score when somebody else, anybody else, was guarding him. And that opportunity arose several times, either because IU was setting screens and Purdue was switching and Langford was now defended by Trevion Williams or Matt Haarms or Ryan Cline, or because Eastern was on the bench to get some rest. Hey, a guy gets tired shutting off an NBA lottery pick while producing the first double-double of his career, as Eastern did Saturday with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\nBy the end of the game, IU coach Archie Miller didn\u2019t even want Romeo on the floor. He substituted for Langford with 3:19 left and the Hoosiers trailing 62-48, leaving him on the bench for almost two minutes. Romeo wasn\u2019t in foul trouble (two fouls, both in the first half). Wasn\u2019t tired (just 22 minutes played). It was just: Romeo wasn\u2019t helping. In his 22 minutes on the court, IU was minus-16. In his 18 minutes off the court, IU outscored Purdue by a point.\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain any of that, because Romeo is not \u201coverrated,\u201d as the Purdue crowd was chanting throughout the second half. Before Saturday, Romeo had scored in double figures in each of Indiana\u2019s first 17 games, and in league play he was leading the Big Ten at 21.3 ppg. Romeo is exactly who we\u2019ve thought he was since his IndyStar Mr. Basketball tenure at New Albany: A scoring savant. A future NBA lottery pick.\nBut Eastern is one of the most difficult defenders in the country, an enormous college guard with NBA length and strength. He has the quickness to defend smaller players and the strength \u2014 he benches-presses right at 300 pounds \u2014 to defend the 6-6, 215-pound Langford. In just a minute I\u2019m going to show you what Eastern did to Langford, and what a few of his teammates did as well. But before we get there, let\u2019s make something clear:\nThis game wasn\u2019t a fluke. Not for either team. It was an accurate indicator of where each program is, right now. Where is IU? In the dumpster. On fire. The Hoosiers have lost four in a row, including back-to-back 15-point losses against Nebraska (at home) and Purdue.\nAnd again, let\u2019s not pin this loss solely on Romeo. Save a pin for IU coach Archie Miller, whose overall future I believe in, same as I believe in Romeo, but who has lost his team.\nMiller conceded as much after the Nebraska game \u2014 \u201cWhy guys aren\u2019t excited to get ready to go tonight, as much as we had at stake \u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said Monday \u2014 and senior captain Juwan Morgan was equally disgusted. And it didn\u2019t get better on Saturday. No, it got worse. The Hoosiers couldn\u2019t make a 3-pointer (4-for-20), but by golly that didn\u2019t stop them from trying. They couldn\u2019t make a one-pointer either: 7-for-18 on free throws, and they had to make their last three just to do that.\nBut IU had more than a shooting problem, or a shot-selection problem. The Hoosiers looked silly on defense, allowing the 7-3 Haarms to roll to the basket unimpeded, time and time again, after setting screens for Carsen Edwards or Ryan Cline. IU was so spooked by the range of Edwards (20 points) and Cline (eight) that it ignored Haarms (12 points on 6-for-8 shooting, including four dunks), who spent the final 25 minutes dangling from the rim. The Hoosiers made zero adjustments. That\u2019s coaching. Let\u2019s call it what it is.\nAnd let\u2019s do the same for Purdue, which has won three in a row and six of seven \u2014 and which beat IU for the seventh time in eight games, the first 7-1 series spurt for either program since IU did it from 1972-76 \u2014 and point out how the Boilermakers are coming together at the same time the Hoosiers are falling apart. Matt Painter has developed Trevion Williams into a low-post monster who started on Saturday, and in Aaron Wheeler and Sasha Stefanovic he has two more quality pieces for a bench that now includes Haarms.\nHow much better is Purdue today than a month ago? A month ago, Carsen Edwards was scoring 40 efficient points (15-for-26 from the floor, 7-for-14 on 3-pointers) and Purdue was still losing 72-68 to Texas, the most galling point of a seven-game stretch where the Boilermakers went 2-5 with Edwards averaging 25 ppg. On Saturday, Purdue got an inefficient 20 points from Edwards \u2014 6-for-18 from the floor, 3-for-10 on 3-pointers \u2014 and still beat IU by 15.\nBut then, IU is in a dumpster. And the dumpster is on fire.\nInsider:IU's once-promising season is suddenly sinking, and concerns are justified\nAnd on Saturday it was Nojel Eastern lighting the match and throwing it on Langford, simply taking the ball from him for one of Langford\u2019s three turnovers in the first half, and swatting his 3-pointer out of the air in the second half, when Langford was still daring to shoot against him. All told Langford attempted 10 shots Saturday, but seven came when the primary defender was anyone else. Against Eastern, who was picking him up 35 feet from the rim and fighting around or through screens to stay on him, Langford was 0-for-3.\nLangford wasn\u2019t a whole lot better against everybody else (2-for-7). He tried a layup that Haarms pinned against the glass. Another time he attacked Aaron Wheeler, a really bad idea given Wheeler\u2019s 6-9 size and NBA hops. Whatever Romeo had in mind \u2014 dunk? layup? \u2014 will remain a mystery, because Wheeler met him in mid-air and swatted the ball before Langford could finish.\nBut Langford was at his worst against nobody at all. He missed all four of his free throws, and this happened the one time Langford was completely open on Saturday, a corner-3-pointer with Cline at least 10 feet away on the closeout.\nAir ball.

The UK government suspects the Skripals were victims of a Russian attack.\nThe UK\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Policing Network is leading the investigation. Officers are investigating the possibility of a connection between the two attacks, said Neil Basu, Assistant Commissioner for Counter Terrorism at London Metropolitan Police. But no evidence so far suggests the couple was specifically targeted, he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any intelligence or evidence that they were targeted in any way. There is nothing in their background to suggest that at all,\u201d Basu said.\n\u201cWe are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to. The possibility that these two investigations might be linked is clearly a line of inquiry for us.\u201d\nWhat we know about the victims\nParamedics were called to an address on Muggleton Road in Amesbury the morning of June 30 after a woman collapsed at the property, Wiltshire Police Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills told reporters earlier Wednesday. They were called back later the same day after reports that a man became ill in the same location, he said.\nBritish news agencies identified the two people as Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44. Sam Hobson, a friend of the pair, confirmed their names in an interview with Agence France-Presse.

The Canes have stepped up their offensive production of late, tallying three goals or more in nine of their past ten games played.

Despite being on a four-game Eastern road swing, the Jets will avoid a back-to-back, which is certainly a bonus for teams as the season grinds to a close. The Jets will hope that the ability on the road trip to add in valuable practice time will get newly acquired Kevin Hayes acclimated in a hurry. Hayes has already produced three points (one goal) in his four games with the Jets. Additionally, they will seek to get the dynamic Patrik Laine on track, as he has slipped to only 44 points on the season after notching 64 and 70 respectively in his first two NHL seasons.\nPaul Maurice on tonight\u2019s lineup, Sani Niku\u2019s game, and more prior to facing the Hurricanes. #WPGvsCAR pic.twitter.com/Jw7jEsSbkF \u2014 Winnipeg Jets (@NHLJets) March 8, 2019\nFormer Canes coach Paul Maurice returns to Raleigh again, but will be without Dustin Byfuglien and Josh Morrissey on his blueline.

Another dietary flip-flop to digest (pardon the pun). The latest one involves eggs, a food that\u2019s been a source of controversy for decades.\nA large study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) concluded a higher intake of eggs and dietary cholesterol significantly increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and premature death.\nThe debate over eggs revolves around their high cholesterol-content (185 milligrams for every large egg, all in the yolk). Consuming too much cholesterol has been thought to raise LDL (bad) blood cholesterol, an established risk factor for heart attack and stroke.\nThe new findings come not long after the U.S. government removed the daily cholesterol limit of 300 mg from its 2015-20 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, stating cholesterol is no longer a \u201cnutrient of concern for overconsumption.\u201d The consensus among scientists: Cholesterol in food has little effect on the amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream.\nIn the face of this contradictory information, however, here\u2019s what you need to know about the latest research.\nAbout the new study\nThe JAMA study analyzed data from 29,615 healthy adults who were enrolled in six different studies, spanning up to 31 years of follow-up, in order to determine if dietary cholesterol or egg consumption was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease or death from any cause.\nCardiovascular disease was defined as the composite of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure and cardiovascular death from other causes.\nThe main finding was that higher consumption of eggs and cholesterol (sources included eggs and meats), beyond average intake, was tied to a significantly greater risk of both outcomes in a dose-dependent manner.\nStudy participants consumed, on average, 285 mg of cholesterol a day and two eggs a week.\nEating an additional 300 mg of cholesterol a day was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause death by 17 and 18 per cent, respectively. Eating an extra three to four eggs each week was tied to a 6 per cent higher risk of cardiovascular disease and 8 per cent increased risk of any cause of death.\nThese findings remained true after accounting for age, exercise, smoking status, alcohol intake and overall diet quality. Even in the context of a heart-healthy diet, a higher cholesterol intake was found to be harmful.\nLimitations, strengths\nLike most nutrition studies, this one is not without limitations. And there are a few.\nThe six studies included in the JAMA analysis relied on self-reported data; having to recall what you ate in the past month is prone to error.\nWhat\u2019s more, dietary data was collected only once at the beginning of each study. The fact that long-term eating patterns were not assessed is a major limitation, since people may have changed their diets over the years of follow up.\nLDL blood cholesterol levels, which, when elevated, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, were not assessed.\nThis observational study suggests only that a relationship exists between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease; it does not prove that higher egg and cholesterol consumption causes it.\nKeep in mind, also, that previous studies have come to opposite conclusions.\nStill, this doesn\u2019t mean that these findings should be completely dismissed. According to an editorial in JAMA, the study\u2019s large dataset and rigorous methodology make a strong case that eggs and dietary cholesterol intake influence the risk of cardiovascular disease.\nAnd while the overall relationship between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease was modest, the results suggest that the risk may be greater for people who consume eggs and cholesterol substantially above average intakes.\nEverything you need to know about eating nuts (and preventing diabetes)\nSugar-free? Unsweetened? No added sugar? How to decode sugar labels\nCan I eat lots of beans without experiencing gas?\nSo now what?\nShould you swap your sunny-side up for a whites-only omelet?\nIt\u2019s not necessary to stop eating whole eggs, which are packed with nutrition.\nThey\u2019re an excellent source of protein, 42 per cent of which is found in the yolk. Eggs also deliver plenty of vitamin B12 (half a day\u2019s worth in one large egg) and selenium, a mineral that protects DNA in cells and is needed for thyroid function.\nThat said, if you eat a lot of egg yolks (e.g., two or more a day), consider eating them in moderation.\nRemember, too, that preventing cardiovascular disease is about a whole lot more than watching your egg or cholesterol intake.\nMaintaining a healthy weight, getting regular exercise and eating an overall healthy diet that emphasizes fibre-rich whole grains, fruits, vegetables and plant proteins and limits refined starchy foods, added sugars and saturated and trans fats remain important preventive strategies.\nLeslie Beck, a Toronto-based private practice dietitian, is Director of Food and Nutrition at Medcan.\nLive your best.

Mueller III may find criminal conduct but decline to indict; or he may find damning misconduct but nothing illegal; and in either of those cases, any impeachment effort could end up foundering amid the skittishness of House Democrats or, if not, crashing against the wall of the GOP Senate. In these scenarios, Trump could easily get reelected.\nAdvertisement\nBut if BuzzFeed\u2019s stunning new report is true, we could be looking at a real inflection point in this whole story:\nPresident Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter. Trump also supported a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet President Vladimir Putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. \u201cMake it happen,\u201d the sources said Trump told Cohen. And even as Trump told the public he had no business deals with Russia, the sources said Trump and his children Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. received regular, detailed updates about the real estate development from Cohen, whom they put in charge of the project.\nHere are five big takeaways from this new reporting:\nFollow Greg Sargent 's opinions Follow\nIf Cohen can really testify to this, it may be confirmed sooner than we think. According to the two anonymous sources who spoke to BuzzFeed, Cohen told the special counsel that the president personally instructed him to lie to Congress about the duration of negotiations over Trump Tower Moscow, to obscure his involvement.\nThis, of course, would be suborning perjury, which is a crime. BuzzFeed claims that the special counsel \u201clearned about Trump\u2019s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.\u201d That\u2019s awfully specific and suggests hard evidence exists. (The White House has not commented.)\nAdvertisement\nWe may not have to wait for Mueller to conclude before learning more. Remember, Cohen is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Feb. 7, and Democrats can ask him about all of this.\nThe complication here, according to Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, is that Cohen may be constrained from talking about this due to an arrangement with Mueller of some kind. \u201cIf Cohen has any kind of agreement with Mueller not to reveal some of the contents of his communications, or the nature of the physical evidence supporting his claims, that\u2019s where I think it gets tricky,\u201d Vladeck said.\nOf course, if Cohen says, \u201cI can\u2019t discuss this because of a prior arrangement with Mueller,\u201d rather than, \u201cNo, this is not true,\u201d that alone would be awfully suggestive.\nAdvertisement\nMueller has already hinted at this in his sentencing document. Remember, in his document on Cohen\u2019s sentencing, Mueller stated that Cohen, who is cooperating, has assisted with \u201ccore topics under investigation\u201d by the special counsel and has provided \u201ccredible and consistent\u201d information.\nBut the document also says Cohen \u201cdescribed the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries.\u201d\nIf BuzzFeed\u2019s report is true, this was likely a reference by Mueller, at least in part, to \u201ccircumstances\u201d that included a directive from the president himself. Those understated sentences suddenly loom a lot larger.\nTrump repeatedly talked up Russian President Vladimir Putin to American voters during this period. The BuzzFeed report tells us this:\nTrump was even made aware that Cohen was speaking to Russian government officials about the deal. The lawyer at one point spoke to a Kremlin aide as he sought support for the tower. Trump also encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to Russia during the campaign, where the candidate could meet face-to-face with Putin.\nIf true, it seems plausible or even likely that Trump knew the Kremlin was being consulted about his Trump Tower deal, and he wanted to make a trip to see Putin, likely about this very topic.\nAdvertisement\nLet\u2019s not forget that, during the period in question, Republican primary voters were choosing their party\u2019s presidential candidate, and again and again, Trump talked up the need for better relations with Russia and Putin, and publicly absolved Putin of various nefarious charges against him. He presented this as a good-faith description of what he saw to be in the national interest. But if the BuzzFeed report is correct, he understood that he had a direct financial stake in making this argument to a far greater degree than we thought.\nThe new story suggests Donald Trump Jr. may have committed perjury. The BuzzFeed report says:\nDonald Trump Jr., meanwhile, testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, 2017, that he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the plan to build a tower in Moscow. \u201cMost of my knowledge has been gained since as it relates to hearing about it over the last few weeks.\u201d The two law enforcement sources disputed this characterization and said that he and Cohen had multiple, detailed conversations on this subject during the campaign.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s contemporaneous physical evidence backing up this reporting,\u201d Vladeck told me, \u201cthat evidence could be proof that Junior perjured himself when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhat if there are tapes? We know that Cohen had a tendency to record his calls, including those with Donald Trump. Maybe he didn\u2019t record any of these particular communications. But throughout this whole tale, the limits on the plausible have continued to give away to the remarkable-but-true.\nWhether there are tapes or not, the BuzzFeed report suggests that law enforcement has hard evidence Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress. And if that is the case, it could prove pivotal, just as it did during Watergate.\n\u201cThrough the spring of 1974, it seemed totally plausible that Nixon would fight his way through the investigation and survive,\u201d historian Julian Zelizer, the co-author of a new book about the history of the United States since 1974, told me. \"Then the tapes emerged, and suddenly it was impossible to imagine him surviving.\u201d\nRead more:\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "sid": 8, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "8995190410351827876", "docid": 1, "url": "https://deadspin.com/the-nba-shouldnt-get-credit-just-for-not-being-the-nfl-1826313089", "ms_text": "P____ : R_____ M_______ ( G____ I_____\nA____ o_ h__ t___\u2019s G___ 5 m______ w___ t__ R______ t______, W_______ c____ S____ K___ t___ t___ t_ b____ t__ N__ f__ i__ n__ r___ b______ p______ f___ k_______ d_____ t__ n_______ a_____.", "full_text": "Ahead of his team\u2019s Game 5 matchup with the Rockets tonight, Warriors coach Steve Kerr took time to blast the NFL for its new rule banning players from kneeling during the national anthem.

This was Kevin Durant giving the business to Patrick Beverley in the final minutes of a playoff game. For a mouthy LA Clippers guard and physical defender who lives to irritate, this was nothing unusual for Beverley to be in such a situation.\nAs for Durant, this is becoming familiar for the Golden State Warriors\u2019 All-Star \u2026 and no one is sure whether that\u2019s a good thing.\nDurant has never been known for being quick-tempered and easily aggravated throughout much of his career, until recently. As solid as this season has gone for Durant \u2014 wherein he\u2019s still established as among the game\u2019s top five players and on track for another championship \u2014 it\u2019s been a perplexing one because of his demeanor.\nDurant has clashed with referees, had an in-game dust-up with teammate Draymond Green, racked up technical fouls at an unprecedented pace (for him), cursed the media multiple times for having the audacity to wonder where he\u2019ll play next season and just conducted a game-long trash-talking session with Beverley in which Warriors coach Steve Kerr admitted Durant \u201ctook the bait.\u201d\nAnd so this is a reasonable question: What\u2019s eating Kevin Durant?\nAsked this Sunday on the eve of Game 2, Kerr, a perceptive coach who has an answer or theory for almost everything, took a pass.\nIs Durant feeling angst regarding his free agency this summer? If anything, that should be embraced. Durant will be in high demand and will command a maximum contract that will pay upwards of $200 million. He can stay with the Warriors and flanked by All-Stars and play in a new arena in San Francisco, or move to a place \u2014 New York, perhaps \u2014 he can call his own. Where\u2019s the annoyance in that?\nOn the surface, Durant seemingly has a charmed life, someone who has it all: Unfathomable riches, good health, maybe a third championship soon, adoring fans, the perks that come with being famous, high respect in the basketball world for his skills and a case for being among the greatest players of all time.\nBut there\u2019s obviously something we don\u2019t see or understand that\u2019s causing Durant to become moody.\nBut this was a transformation to a degree. Durant is worshipped at the University of Texas, despite playing only one season there. Folks speak glowingly of his character and especially his generosity by returning and funding athletic programs.\nIn Seattle, his first NBA stop, Durant was an affable young player who showed maturity beyond his years, a trait that followed him to Oklahoma City after the SuperSonics relocated. When a deadly and destructive tornado caused lives to unravel in central Oklahoma in 2013, Durant pledged his time and money to help the recovery efforts.\nAnd he teared up at his Kia MVP ceremony in 2014, thanking his mother and also saluting teammate Russell Westbrook, a relationship that became fractured and combative after Durant defected to Golden State.\nThe first time his personality shift took place publicly came during his exit strategy from OKC to the Warriors during free agency. He was caught off guard by the not-so-favorable reaction, heightened by the presence of social media. Durant\u2019s response was to return fire rather than ignore the noise and clumsily created a burner account to go on the attack.\nIt was astonishing to see: A celebrated and accomplished athlete with global fame trading shots with Bob from Wisconsin.\nThis only fed the perception of Durant being hypersensitive and thin-skinned, caring too much about what others think of him.\nHe took his battles to the media, throwing all reporters (even those who don\u2019t handicap his upcoming free-agent choices) on the firing line, often peppering his scolding with expletives. Other times, Durant became curt and short with his answers during interview sessions, whereas before, he was expansive, thoughtful, engaging and unfailingly friendly.\nAll that matters is what happens between the lines on the court, and yet: Durant had 15 technical fouls this season. That\u2019s one shy of tying Green for league-high and did not do so only because one tech was rescinded by the NBA.\nHis barking at Beverley wasn\u2019t a crime in and of itself. For the most part, Durant had a smile on his face, has known Beverley for years, and the chatter between them Saturday didn\u2019t appear to cross the line or lead to a physical confrontation.\nBut by getting two technicals with his ejection, Durant can only get four more throughout the playoffs before each subsequent technical results in a one-game suspension. Beverley will likely not have a long postseason, but Durant certainly will. Therefore, advantage, Beverley.\nWill this prove costly for Durant and the Warriors in, say, late May or June, if and when they\u2019re chasing champagne?\n\u201cI\u2019m in control,\u201d Durant said, dismissing that chance.\nBut at this point, given his pattern of late, nothing is for certain. Kerr discussed the importance of keeping cool in the presence of Beverley and anyone else, for that matter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s two technicals,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou get seven technicals, your seventh one is a suspension in the playoffs, whether you play four playoff games or 24, seven is the magic number. So, he\u2019s got four to play with after one game. And that\u2019s what Beverley does.\n\u201cWe talked about it the last couple days. He\u2019s a hell of a defender who plays hard. We have a lot of respect for him. But you cannot take the bait because that\u2019s a bad trade for us. You just can\u2019t do it. The Clippers have made a lot of good trades this year, and that was maybe their best.\u201d\nYes, because although the victory was already in hand for the Warriors, a seed was planted by Beverley.\nNeither Kerr or Durant believe Beverley will get under the skin of the two-time Finals MVP again. The bigger picture lies with the games beyond the first round, assuming the Warriors move forward.\nThe Durant we see before us today is edgier, saltier, more willing to express himself in ways that aren\u2019t always productive. Durant has gone hardcore, and it certainly makes him more interesting, though to what end?\n* * *\nShaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The company began to push the envelope with the 2016 Mavic Pro that offered 4K video in a portable package. And although the Spark didn\u2019t offer 4K footage, it came with smarts that made the drone fun and easy to use. Last year's Mavic Air then combined the best of both worlds, becoming what we consider to be the best travel drone you can currently buy.\nDJI's not resting on its laurels, however, and was originally scheduled to host a big event on July 18 (US time) \u2013 one where the company had invited attendees to \u201csee the bigger picture\u201d.\nThat event has however since been postponed, and while it's not quite 100 percent confirmation that a Mavic successor was what DJI was planning on revealing on the day, a purported image of the company's next major consumer drone was leaked online over the weekend \u2013 and it shows off several new features.\nLeaked image of DJI Mavic 2 | Image courtesy: DroneDJ\nFlying high\nWebsite DroneDJ was the first to publish the image of the new drone, which displays the name \u2018Mavic 2\u2019 printed on a foldable propeller arm. The copter appears to have a sleeker and more aerodynamic design compared to the Mavic Air, but retains the basic character of the Mavic Pro in terms of shape and color.\nFrom the parts on the table in the image, the Mavic 2 appears to include a removable gimbal, like the one on the competing GoPro Karma . And given DJI\u2019s sell for its postponed event mentioned \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d, it seems logical that the other key addition could be a wide-angle lens. That\u2019s something DJI already offers on select models in its Phantom series.\nRead more: DJI Phantom 4 review\nReports have also suggested that the upcoming drone could include additional sensors on the bottom and the back, which combined with the existing front and side sensors would provide 360-degree obstacle avoidance. This could be a huge selling point for the drone in terms of ease-of-use, and DJI has already demonstrated its obstacle-avoidance tech works well on previous models, albeit in a more limited fashion.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to DJI for comments on the leak, but are yet to receive a response.

They both appear rusty and out of practice.\nDirector Tigmanshu Dhulia\u2019s new film, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3, tries to be a political thriller, but fails to look any different from a cringe-worthy television soap where everybody is plotting against everybody. It\u2019s a total waste of actors, resources and the audience\u2019s time. It teaches patience though. You simply surrender yourself after the first few minutes. Here on, it\u2019s all about bizarre plot twists, painful song sequences and drunk royals. In the end, you emerge a better person with new-found resilience.\nAditya Pratap Singh (Jimmy Shergill) and his wife Madhavi (Mahie Gill) are still playing games with each other. Aditya, who was jailed in the previous film, has returned and is trying to reclaim his political legacy. After some twists and turns, he meets a London-returned Rajasthan prince Uday Pratap Singh (Sanjay Dutt), and that begins a chain of accidents.\nTo be fair, Sanjay Dutt\u2019s inclusion in the cast makes the series bigger but it also snatches the focus from its old characters. Jimmy Shergill, among the most capable actors in first two films, gets a chance to redeem himself only in the second half. The damage is irrevocable though. Mahie Gill\u2019s conniving queen act is absurd beyond comprehension.In her defence, she swirls, screams and spills her drink more fluently than before but there is no method in this madness anymore.\nBlaring speakers announce Baba\u2019s return but the effect doesn\u2019t last long. Sanjay\u2019s \u2018swag\u2019 dies before the gunslinger he is battling with. Then there are characters without much of an explanation. Kabir Bedi and Deepak Tijori\u2019s characters are so thin and so loudly performed that one may wonder whether Tigmanshu was under pressure to finish the shooting in just one go.\nWhat started as a story of dejected princes with uncontrollable urge to rule has transformed into a strange tale of psychopaths running down each other. Tigmanshu no longer controls this world of ghostly estates and treacherous relatives. The original story still functions as the reference point but it has been pared down to the bones.\nThe dialogues in Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3 are expected to bring out the gritty side of the actors but they do exactly the opposite. They are forced, not in tandem with their surrounding and tonally different from the film. It\u2019s a forgettable world that can\u2019t boast of even one memorable scene.\nThe complexity of the relationship between Jimmy and Mahie is not a point of concern for the writers. They have assumed that the audience already knows it after the past films. That leaves the two actors grasping for straws. Actually, whatever worked in the previous films is absent here and add-ons are totally out of sync.\nThe royals of Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3 patronise obscure traditions and look more ancient than a \u201870s film. It offers nothing other than a niggling ache. It\u2019s certainly a question mark on Tigmanshu\u2019s otherwise satisfactory filmography.\nInteract with Rohit Vats at twitter/@nawabjha\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "11148813158314653055", "docid": 1, "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/saheb-biwi-aur-gangster-3-movie-review-sanjay-dutt-rating-5278833/", "ms_text": "S____ B___ A__ G_______ 3 m____ r_____: M___ m___ m____ h__ b___ s____ i_ t___ p___, t_ m___ i_ p______.", "full_text": "Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3 movie cast: Sanjay Dutt, Jimmy Shergill, Mahi Gill, Deepraj Rana, Chitrangada Singh, Deepak Tijori, Kabir Bedi, Soha Ali Khan, Nafisa Ali\nSaheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3 movie director: Tigmanshu Dhulia\nSaheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3 movie rating: 2 stars\nThe SBAG rajwaada is back for a third-go-round, and so is the series\u2019 hallmark murderous intrigue and bloody ambition, and familiar characters reprising their roles, with a new addition or two.\nSaheb (Shergill) is plotting to get out of jail, where we left him at the end of the second instalment.

Chitrangada Singh is as relevant in the film as Melania Trump is in the White House.\nThe film is a thriller crafted as a drama, which dilutes its pace and rhythm. Whatever little momentum the thriller aspect of this film creates, is washed out by the lacklustre drama that constantly interjects the narrative. The farcical \u2018swag\u2019 generated through dialogue and background score is never met with sleek visuals. Instead, the filmmaker tries to convince you that a film city set is a posh club in London, called House of Lords, by using establishing shots of the British capital. It\u2019s Dutt who runs the place and gets deported for smashing a bottle on a white customer\u2019s head, giving way to the second half of the film, bringing along more arbitrariness. There\u2019s random sex, flirtation and dropping of the sari pallu -- none of which is aesthetically pleasing. The film has no memorable songs either and even fails to move you with a cover of the popular Lata Mangeshkar song, Lag Ja Gale . With a hint of another sequel, either Dhulia takes a hard look at the relevance of this franchise, or convinces Salman Khan for a \u2018he is the bhai\u2019 edition and mint money.", "sid": 9, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "7778653768428723000", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/sanju-movie-review-ranbir-kapoor-is-flawless-in-rajkumar-hiranis-bollywood-ised-biopic-of-sanjay-dutt-4622211.html", "ms_text": "S____: R_____ K_____ i_ f_______ i_ R_______ H_____'s B________-i___ b_____ o_ S_____ D___\nT__ f____ t____ y__ n_____ a____ R_____ K_____ i_ S____ i__'t h__ u______ s_________ t_ S_____ D___, o_ t___ h_'s a f________ a____ w___ t__ a______ t_ m____ i___ h__ s______ l___ a c________.", "full_text": "The first thing you notice about Ranbir Kapoor in Sanju isn't his uncanny similarity to Sanjay Dutt, or that he's a fantastic actor with the ability to morph into his subject like a chameleon. It is that there's absolutely nothing in Ranbir's portrayal to complain about.\nThis isn't merely a case of \"look how easily Ranbir has slipped into Sanjay Dutt's shoes\" \u2014 this is about the way in which every single aspect of the controversial actor has been imbibed by the ever-so-talented Kapoor \u2014 from his slouching walk, his goofy eyes that reveal so much pain and also a yearning for pleasure, to the way he talks (a mix of Bumbaiya and posh English) and the way he acts.\nThis is a meta performance. Ranbir Kapoor acts like Sanjay Dutt, who is an actor by profession. Sanju is so much more than Sanjay Dutt though. And Ranbir Kapoor. Yes, the film serves primarily as a platform for Ranbir Kapoor \u2014 and his talent \u2014 to show us the intricacies of Sanjay Dutt's life. But one person's story rarely makes a good film. Sanju is as much about Paresh Rawal's restrained performance, as a helpless father torn between love for his son and his moral code. It is as much about Manisha Koirala, Sonam Kapoor and Dia Mirza, who each play memorable (but ultimately secondary) characters in Dutt's life. Manisha is particularly refreshing as Nargis Dutt and it is a delight to watch her on the big screen.\nAlso read \u2014 Why Rajkumar Hirani's Sanju will be considered a unique film, regardless of its box office fate\nThe first 90 minutes of Sanju, however, belong to the heart-warming bromance between Ranbir as Dutt, and Vicky Kaushal, as his friend from the US, Kamlesh aka Kamli. It is through their friendship, and Dutt's relationship with his father, that the plot of Sanju unfurls.\nSanju presents the intimate details of Sanjay Dutt's life in a typically Hirani-esque manner. There's an emotional message in every potential scene; the film doesn't attempt to decode Sanjay Dutt or justify his life. Credit to Hirani for not painting Dutt with larger than life strokes. But there is a Bollywood-ish tinge to every scene.\nThrough his first shot in his debut film Rocky, and the songs he sings with his then-girlfriend Ruby (Sonam Kapoor); through his fight with drug addiction and his stint in the US, where he spends his last few moments with mother Nargis; through his moments of friendship with a real friend (Vicky Kaushal) or a fake friend who gets him hooked onto drugs (Zubin Mistry, played by the wonderful Jim Sarbh) \u2014 Sanju is a Bollywood-ised account of Sanju Dutt's life. It's dramatic, calculatingly exciting and yet, cinematic.\nSanju's biggest accomplishment is undoubtedly its performances. There are genuinely some shots where you won't be able to tell you're looking at Ranbir Kapoor, and not Sanjay Dutt. Vicky Kaushal shines, holding his own in the fun moments as well as serious scenes. Sanju is a gripping film, but one treads with caution.\nEditor's pick \u2014 Ranbir Kapoor on Sanju: Not a propaganda film but an honest portrayal of a flawed human being\nCaution because the agenda of Sanju is clear: to present a seemindgly misunderstood story. To tell audiences that there are two sides to everything. But to do so with a kind of emotional manipulation that you may not even recognise.\nThere is no doubt that Sanju is a great story. Even though this is so obviously Sanjay Dutt's life account, we are told Kamlesh's perspective, as the friend of a superstar/drug addict/limelight hogger. We are told Vinnie Diaz's perspective (Anushka Sharma) \u2014 a biographer who slowly but surely falls in love with Sanjay Dutt's story.\nIt is the performances in Sanju that often make up for the one-dimensional writing.\nHirani makes it easier for audiences to engage with the film by broadly dividing Dutt's life into two parts \u2014 his fight with drug addiction, and the jail term for his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts. But Sanju seems stuck in its own mould. It rarely rises above the boundaries it creates for itself. Hirani sticks so close to what he knows best \u2014 mixing commercial elements into a story with potential \u2014 that Sanju ends up feel like a version of Dutt's life for children; a sanitised fable of sorts. You are very often left wanting more. What about the greys? What about the philosophical conflicts?\nThis gap is filled by Ranbir Kapoor \u2014 a fine performer who understands his subject matter and audience. The film best moments belong to Ranbir and Vicky Kaushal, and Ranbir and Paresh Rawal.\nGlimpses into the film industry and the underworld are minimal. We are not given an insight into the socio-cultural context in which Sanjay Dutt's life unfolded. It would have been nice to see the world that Dutt inhabited (and now inhabits) with a little more depth. But worry not, the physicality of every character makes up for the lack of context. Each character looks their part. Aiding the narrative is a hummable soundtrack that one may not remember over time but works within the film.\nUltimately Sanju is Ranbir Kapoor and Vicky Kaushal's film. Both actors pull even the flawed parts of the film together, and neatly wrap the histrionics with flavour and variety. Sanju is an entertaining film, and has all the elements of a blockbuster \u2014 but one wishes the honesty and nuance went beyond just the performances.\nRead on Firstpost \u2014 Sanju doesn't whitewash or dilute anything about Sanjay Dutt's life: Paresh Rawal on Rajkumar Hirani's biopic\nNote: This is a first impression of the film Sanju.

Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) held off a challenger to his left in Thursday\u2019s primary, decisively defeating activist Kerri Harris in one of the last intraparty brawls of the year. Carper, 71, is now favored to win a fourth term in a state where his center-left politics have helped shape its business-friendly Democratic Party. But the challenge from Harris, a 38-year old Air Force veteran making her first run for office, revealed a shift in Carper\u2019s party and the existence of a left-wing vote bloc in a state where moderate suburbanites typically dominate.\nThat bloc was not large enough to give Carper a scare, however: Harris got 35 percent of the vote, easily eclipsed by Carper\u2019s 65 percent.\nDemocrats are fed up and fired up,\u201d Carper said after the votes were tallied. \u201cIf we can keep the energy up, Democrats are going to win up and down the ballot in Delaware and across the country this fall, and then go on to defeat Donald Trump and his reckless agenda in 2020. Count me in.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe senator, who has won 12 general elections for various offices in Delaware \u2014 and lost none \u2014 did not immediately seem vulnerable to a challenge. Republicans, who were also picking a nominee Thursday, struggled to find a first-tier challenger; Sussex County councilman Rob Arlett claimed the nomination Thursday with 67 percent of the vote.\nIn the first six months of her campaign, Harris raised less than $25,000, not enough to run a credible race in a state with 367,000 registered Democrats.\nBut the June 26 primary victory of New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a booster shot for the left, and for insurgent groups such as Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party. Both made their first-ever interventions in Delaware politics, as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign sent staff to Delaware to build a voter-targeting campaign for Harris.\nAdvertisement\nUnlike longtime incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley, who lost to Ocasio-Cortez, Carper was not caught by surprise.\nHe outspent Harris by a 10-1 ratio, building a field team before hers got going and buying up digital ads targeted at the state\u2019s sometimes-sleepy Democratic electorate. Joe Biden recorded a robo-call for him, talking up the very record that Harris attacked \u2014 eight years as a triangulating, popular governor, and 18 years as a centrist senator who sometimes broke with his party, mostly on banking and finance issues. Carper also shifted noticeably to the left, coming out for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and decriminalized marijuana.\nHarris argued that Carper\u2019s \u201clens\u201d as an established, business-friendly politician had led him into dangerous blunders. In a debate, she rounded on Carper for supporting a partial rollback of Dodd-Frank bank regulations, for initially backing the Iraq War, and for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh when he was put up for a lower court.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFool me once, shame on me,\u201d said Carper, who has said he will oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s current nomination.\nNo Democratic senator has lost a primary since 2006, when then-Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut responded to his defeat by mounting and winning an independent campaign. But the idea of building a liberal beachhead in Delaware, and of signaling to other Democrats that they could not take activists\u2019 votes for granted, proved attractive to insurgents.\nSome of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s key campaign staff headed to Delaware in July. After the Aug. 7 Michigan primary, when liberal gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed fell short, his digital director, Claire Sandberg, headed east to direct a $100,000 independent expenditure on Harris\u2019s behalf, paid for by the New York-based Working Families Party.\nThe primary election that loomed over Delaware Democrats happened in 2010. That was the year that longtime House member Mike Castle, a moderate Republican running for a then-open Senate seat, was defeated by conservative activist Christine O\u2019Donnell. The scandal-plagued O\u2019Donnell went on to lose to now-Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D), bucking a national trend that year in favor of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nHarris and her supporters insisted that she would hold the seat for the Democrats in November, pointing to Delaware\u2019s blue tilt \u2014 Donald Trump won just 41.7 percent of the state\u2019s vote \u2014 and Republican polling that has found her narrowly ahead of any of their candidates. The chance to elect the first black female gay senator of any state, Democratic activists said, would also have attracted donors and activists who had otherwise ignored the race or gotten behind Carper.\n\u201cThe DNC would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re worried,\u2019 \u201d Harris admitted. \u201cBut the wonderful thing about Delaware is that we\u2019re small. We talk to each other. And we have a formula to get people to the polls.\u201d\nRepublicans, who once hoped that Carper would retire this year, had a contentious primary of their own, between former PayPal executive Gene Truono and Arlett, who chaired Trump\u2019s campaign in the state.\nAdvertisement\nThe GOP\u2019s race didn\u2019t received the same attention \u2014 the candidates spent less than $300,000 combined on the primary \u2014 but veered into nastiness. Asked by the state\u2019s biggest newspaper, the News Journal, what the biggest difference between their campaigns was, Arlett said, \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman, and he is not.\u201d\nTruono is openly gay \u2014 and won the paper\u2019s endorsement. But he received only 28 percent of the vote Thursday.\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "sid": 1, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "8777691650326623958", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/sen-thomas-carper-of-delaware-faces-challenge-in-thursday-primary/2018/09/06/87b8797c-b12e-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html", "ms_text": "A_\nB__ t__ J___ 2_ p______ v______ o_ N__ Y___\u2019s A_________ O_____-C_____ w__ a b______ s___ f__ t__ l___, a__ f__ i________ g_____ s___ a_ J______ D________ a__ t__ W______ F_______ P____.", "full_text": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\nWILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 Sen.

But the challenge from Harris, a 38-year old Air Force veteran making her first run for office, revealed a shift in Carper\u2019s party and the existence of a left-wing vote bloc in a state where moderate suburbanites typically dominate.\nThat bloc was not large enough to give Carper a scare, however: Harris got 35 percent of the vote, easily eclipsed by Carper\u2019s 65 percent.\nDemocrats are fed up and fired up,\u201d Carper said after the votes were tallied. \u201cIf we can keep the energy up, Democrats are going to win up and down the ballot in Delaware and across the country this fall, and then go on to defeat Donald Trump and his reckless agenda in 2020. Count me in.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe senator, who has won 12 general elections for various offices in Delaware \u2014 and lost none \u2014 did not immediately seem vulnerable to a challenge. Republicans, who were also picking a nominee Thursday, struggled to find a first-tier challenger; Sussex County councilman Rob Arlett claimed the nomination Thursday with 67 percent of the vote.\nIn the first six months of her campaign, Harris raised less than $25,000, not enough to run a credible race in a state with 367,000 registered Democrats.\nBut the June 26 primary victory of New York\u2019s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was a booster shot for the left, and for insurgent groups such as Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party. Both made their first-ever interventions in Delaware politics, as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign sent staff to Delaware to build a voter-targeting campaign for Harris.\nAdvertisement\nUnlike longtime incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley, who lost to Ocasio-Cortez, Carper was not caught by surprise.\nHe outspent Harris by a 10-1 ratio, building a field team before hers got going and buying up digital ads targeted at the state\u2019s sometimes-sleepy Democratic electorate. Joe Biden recorded a robo-call for him, talking up the very record that Harris attacked \u2014 eight years as a triangulating, popular governor, and 18 years as a centrist senator who sometimes broke with his party, mostly on banking and finance issues. Carper also shifted noticeably to the left, coming out for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and decriminalized marijuana.\nHarris argued that Carper\u2019s \u201clens\u201d as an established, business-friendly politician had led him into dangerous blunders. In a debate, she rounded on Carper for supporting a partial rollback of Dodd-Frank bank regulations, for initially backing the Iraq War, and for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh when he was put up for a lower court.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFool me once, shame on me,\u201d said Carper, who has said he will oppose Kavanaugh\u2019s current nomination.\nNo Democratic senator has lost a primary since 2006, when then-Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut responded to his defeat by mounting and winning an independent campaign. But the idea of building a liberal beachhead in Delaware, and of signaling to other Democrats that they could not take activists\u2019 votes for granted, proved attractive to insurgents.\nSome of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s key campaign staff headed to Delaware in July. After the Aug. 7 Michigan primary, when liberal gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed fell short, his digital director, Claire Sandberg, headed east to direct a $100,000 independent expenditure on Harris\u2019s behalf, paid for by the New York-based Working Families Party.\nThe primary election that loomed over Delaware Democrats happened in 2010. That was the year that longtime House member Mike Castle, a moderate Republican running for a then-open Senate seat, was defeated by conservative activist Christine O\u2019Donnell. The scandal-plagued O\u2019Donnell went on to lose to now-Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D), bucking a national trend that year in favor of Republicans.\nAdvertisement\nHarris and her supporters insisted that she would hold the seat for the Democrats in November, pointing to Delaware\u2019s blue tilt \u2014 Donald Trump won just 41.7 percent of the state\u2019s vote \u2014 and Republican polling that has found her narrowly ahead of any of their candidates. The chance to elect the first black female gay senator of any state, Democratic activists said, would also have attracted donors and activists who had otherwise ignored the race or gotten behind Carper.\n\u201cThe DNC would say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re worried,\u2019 \u201d Harris admitted. \u201cBut the wonderful thing about Delaware is that we\u2019re small. We talk to each other. And we have a formula to get people to the polls.\u201d\nRepublicans, who once hoped that Carper would retire this year, had a contentious primary of their own, between former PayPal executive Gene Truono and Arlett, who chaired Trump\u2019s campaign in the state.\nAdvertisement\nThe GOP\u2019s race didn\u2019t received the same attention \u2014 the candidates spent less than $300,000 combined on the primary \u2014 but veered into nastiness. Asked by the state\u2019s biggest newspaper, the News Journal, what the biggest difference between their campaigns was, Arlett said, \u201cI\u2019m married to a woman, and he is not.\u201d\nTruono is openly gay \u2014 and won the paper\u2019s endorsement. But he received only 28 percent of the vote Thursday.\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "sid": 7, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "8777691650326623958", "docid": 2, "url": "https://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2018/09/04/read-endorsements-all-statewide-primary-election-candidates/1189226002/", "ms_text": "B__ P____ V_____ a_ C___ H_______ H___ S_____ p______ p____ n___ L____ d_____ 2___ e________.", "full_text": "The News Journal\nThe News Journal's editorial board has endorsed candidates in Thursday's Republican and Democratic primary elections for U.S. Senate and in the Democratic primary for Attorney General.

In the host role, he would be expected to stand for long periods of time, write reports and carry up to 25 pounds.\nAdvertisement\nCatlin told The Washington Post, as well as other outlets, including NPR, that the physical requirements of the host job would be impossible, and that he was unsure what other jobs at the store he could do.\nOn Thursday, Walmart told employees that it would hold individual meetings with greeters, with the goal of finding them another job. Typically, employees are given 60 days to find other openings in the company. But Greg Foran, president and chief executive of the company\u2019s U.S. stores, said greeters with disabilities would get an extended window until a solution was found.\n\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Foran wrote, \u201cIf any associate in this unique situation wants to continue working at Walmart, we should make every effort to make that happen.\u201d\nOn Friday, Catlin accepted a job at his store as a self-checkout host.\nIn 2016, Walmart began replacing traditional greeters with \u201ccustomer hosts.\u201d The new job involves welcoming shoppers, as well as checking receipts, helping with returns and keeping a physical presence at the door to deter criminal activity. In stores where greeters were being replaced by hosts, greeters could apply for the role or another job at the store.\nIn a pilot program rolling out the host role, Walmart said more than 80 percent of former greeters were able to find jobs. Those who chose not to stay were offered severance. (Walmart would not disclose how many employees have transitioned to customer hosts since 2016.)\nCraig Goodwin, 39, had been a Walmart greeter for 19 years when he was told that his job was ending April 26. In an interview with The Post, Goodwin said he was told that he could apply for the host position or apply to work in the fitting room. Goodwin was shocked. He loved being a Walmart employee and proudly described being invited to the annual stockholders\u2019 meeting. Goodwin has cerebral palsy and uses a power wheelchair full time. He is also a quadriplegic.\nAdvertisement\nThe fitting room position, according to a company description from last month, requires climbing ladders, carrying weight up to 10 pounds, \u201cbending, twisting, pulling and stooping,\u201d and using fine motor skills.\n\"I thought, after all the good things, you have the nerve to do this to me?\u201d Goodwin told The Post earlier this week.\nOn Friday, Goodwin accepted a job greeting shoppers and working in the self-checkout area at his store outside Chicago. He said he\u2019ll be able to do almost all the requirements of the job, but other employees in the same area can help out with tasks such as replacing receipt tape or punching numbers into a keypad.\nGoodwin said he was glad to rejoin his \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\u201cI feel relieved,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that they reconsidered this, and I hope they\u2019ll make better decisions when they have to deal with this in the future.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDisability rights lawyers said that, from a legal standpoint, Walmart has the right to change an employee\u2019s job description at any time. The company is under a legal obligation to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, so long as those don\u2019t pose an undue burden, usually some high expense, for Walmart. Even with accommodations, disabled employees still have to be able to perform the essential function of a job. For example, legal experts raised questions of whether standing for long periods is essential to the host job.\nCurt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, said he will be watching whether Walmart follows through on its promise to make accommodations for greeters with disabilities. And he raised broader concerns about the stigma that people with disabilities can\u2019t perform as competitively at work.\nBut even in the absence of a pressing legal issue, Walmart\u2019s pledge to deal with each case directly registered with some as a belated public-relations fix. They pointed to the fact that disabled greeters have been affected by these job changes for years, yet Walmart is only publicly addressing the repercussions now.\nAnthony Johndrow, a corporate reputation adviser, said that Walmart\u2019s hiring of disabled workers could have been a story the retailer celebrated. But the company is on the defensive and has scrambled to correct \u201ca PR issue they created.\u201d\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re explaining yourself, you\u2019re losing,\u201d Johndrow said. \u201cThe headlines look bad. ... It feels like them just trying to spin their way out of this.\u201d\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "sid": 9, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}, {"cid": "13109210028842024792", "docid": 1, "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/28/walmart-ceo-stores-taking-steps-support-disabled-greeters/3022707002/", "ms_text": "K____ T___\nU__ T____\nW____ W______ i_ p_______ t_ r______ i__ g_______ w___ c_______ h____, s_____ a__ \"t_____ s_______ s____ t_ s______\" d_______ e________ a_______ b_ t__ c_____, o________ a________ T_______.", "full_text": "While Walmart is planning to replace its greeters with customer hosts, stores are \"taking specific steps to support\" disabled employees affected by the change, officials announced Thursday.\nGreg Foran, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., sent a memo to all store managers Thursday outlining the transition and how \"each case requires a thoughtful solution.\"\nCustomer hosts still greet customers but have added and more physically demanding responsibilities than greeters, which have been part of the company since the early 1980s.

An online petition was started to keep Melton, who has cerebral palsy and can\u2019t walk without assistance, at the store.\nThe Marion Walmart posted on Facebook that Melton will be staying.\n\"We are so excited to announce that Jay has accepted a position as a Self-Checkout Host,\" the Facebook post said. \"Jay has been a part of our store for the last 17 years and is well known throughout our community.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.\nAs Walmart moves to phase out its familiar blue-vested \u201cgreeters\u201d at some 1,000 stores nationwide, disabled workers who fill many of those jobs say they\u2019re being ill-treated by a chain that styles itself as community-minded and inclusive.\nWalmart told greeters around the country last week that their positions would be eliminated on April 26 in favor of an expanded, more physically demanding \u201ccustomer host\u201d role. To qualify, they will need to be able to lift 25-pound (11-kilogram) packages, climb ladders and stand for long periods.\nThat came as a heavy blow to greeters with cerebral palsy, spina bifida and other physical disabilities. For them, a job at Walmart has provided needed income, served as a source of pride and offered a connection to the community.\nNow Walmart, America\u2019s largest private employer, is facing a backlash as customers rally around some of the chain\u2019s most highly visible employees.\nWalmart says it is striving to place greeters in other jobs at the company, but workers with disabilities are worried.\nDonny Fagnano, 56, who has worked at Walmart for more than 21 years, said he cried when a manager at the store in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, called him into the office last week and told him his job was going away.\n\u201cI like working,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than sitting at home.\u201d\nFagnano, who has spina bifida, said he was offered a severance package. He hopes to stay on at Walmart and clean bathrooms instead.\nWalmart greeters have been around for decades, allowing the retail giant to put a friendly face at the front of its stores. Then, in 2016, Walmart began replacing greeters with hosts, adding responsibilities that include helping with returns, checking receipts to deter shoplifters and keeping the front of the store clean. Walmart and other chains have been redefining roles at stores as they compete with Amazon.\nThe effect of the greeter phase-out on disabled and elderly employees \u2014 who have traditionally gravitated toward the role as one they were well-suited to doing \u2014 largely escaped public notice until last week, when Walmart launched a second round of cuts.\nAs word spread, first on social media and then in local and national news outlets, outraged customers began calling Walmart to complain. Tens of thousands of people signed petitions. Facebook groups sprang up with names like \u201cTeam Adam\u201d and \u201cSave Lesley.\u201d A second-grade class in California wrote letters to Walmart\u2019s CEO on behalf of Adam Catlin, a disabled greeter in Pennsylvania whose mother had written an impassioned Facebook post about his plight. Walmart said it has offered another job to Catlin.\nIn Galena, Illinois, hundreds of customers plan to attend an \u201cappreciation parade\u201d for Ashley Powell on her last day of work as a greeter.\n\u201cI love it, and I think I\u2019ve touched a lot of people,\u201d said Powell, 34, who has an intellectual disability.\nIn Vancouver, Washington, John Combs, 42, who has cerebral palsy, was devastated and then angered by his impending job loss. It had taken his family five years to find him a job he could do, and he loved the work, coming up with nicknames for all his co-workers.\n\u201cWhat am I going to do, just sit here on my butt all day in this house? That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to do?\u201d Combs asked his sister and guardian, Rachel Wasser. \u201cI do my job. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\nWasser urged the retailer to \u201cgive these people a fair shake. \u2026 If you want to make your actions match your words, do it. Don\u2019t be a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\nWith the U.S. unemployment rate for disabled people more than twice that for workers without disabilities, Walmart has long been seen as a destination for people like Combs. Advocacy groups worry the company is backsliding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the messaging that concerns me,\u201d said Gabrielle Sedor, chief operations officer at ANCOR, a trade group representing service providers. \u201cGiven that Walmart is such an international leader in the retail space, I\u2019m concerned this decision might suggest to some people that the bottom line of the company is more important to the company than inclusive communities. We don\u2019t think those two are mutually exclusive.\u201d\nThe greeter issue has already prompted at least three complaints to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as a federal lawsuit in Utah alleging discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the federal law, employers must provide \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations to workers with disabilities.\nWalmart did not disclose how many disabled greeters could lose their jobs. The company said that after it made the change at more than 1,000 stores in 2016, 80 to 85 percent of all affected greeters found other roles at Walmart. It did not reveal how many of them were disabled.\nThis time, Walmart initially told greeters they would have 60 days to land other jobs at the company. Amid the uproar, the company has extended the deadline indefinitely for greeters with disabilities.\n\u201cWe recognize that our associates with physical disabilities face a unique situation,\u201d Walmart spokesman Justin Rushing said in a statement. The extra time, he said, will give Walmart a chance to explore how to accommodate such employees.\nWalmart said it has already made offers to some greeters, including those with physical disabilities, and expects to continue doing so in the coming weeks.\nBut some workers say they have been tacitly discouraged from applying for other jobs.\nMitchell Hartzell, 31, a full-time Walmart greeter in Hazel Green, Alabama, said his manager told him \u201cthey pretty much didn\u2019t have anything in that store for me to do\u201d after his job winds down in April. He said he persisted, approaching several assistant managers to ask about openings, and found out about a vacant position at self-checkout. But it had already been promised to a greeter who doesn\u2019t use a wheelchair, he said.\n\u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t want us anymore,\u201d said Hartzell, who has cerebral palsy.\nJay Melton, 40, who has worked as a greeter in Marion, North Carolina, for nearly 17 years, loves church, Tar Heels basketball and Walmart. His sister-in-law, Jamie Melton, said the job is what gets him out of bed.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of things he does himself that bring him joy,\u201d she said. Addressing Walmart, Melton added: \u201cWhen you cut a huge population of people out, and you have written a policy that declares they are no longer capable of doing what they have been doing, that is discrimination.\u201d", "sid": 0, "reason": "sentence_not_found"}]
